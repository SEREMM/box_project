win,dec,12.0,canelo alvarez,58,39,2,2,0,0.03,"Santos Sal ""Canelo"" lvarez Barragn (American Spanish: [saul alaes]; born 18 July 1990) is a Mexican professional boxer. He has won multiple world championships in four weight classes from light middleweight to light heavyweight, including unified titles in three of those weight classes and lineal titles in two. lvarez is the first and only boxer in history to become undisputed champion at super middleweight, having held the WBA (Super), WBC and Ring magazine titles since 2020, and the IBF and WBO titles since 2021.
lvarez is known as an excellent counterpuncher, being able to exploit openings in his opponents' guards while avoiding punches with head and body movement. He is also known as a formidable body puncher. As of May 2022, lvarez is ranked as the world's best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec and the Boxing Writers Association of America, fourth by ESPN, fifth by the TBRB, and sixth by The Ring. He is also ranked as the world's best active super middleweight by BoxRec, The Ring, TBRB, and ESPN.

Early life
In an interview, lvarez explained that he was born on the outskirts of Guadalajara, Jalisco, but his family is originally from Los Reyes, Michoacn. At the age of five, his family moved to their current home of Juanacatln, Jalisco. Growing up on his family's farm, he learned horseback riding, which he continues today. lvarez is the youngest of eight children, seven of them boys; all of his brothers also became professional boxers. Among his brothers are welterweight boxers Ramn lvarez, Ricardo lvarez and former WBA interim world champion, Rigoberto lvarez.Canelo in Spanish is the masculine word for cinnamon, which is a common nickname for people with red hair. His mother, Ana Maria, also has red hair. In Mexico, it is common for people to associate red hair with the Irish soldiers who fought for Mexico in the Saint Patrick's Battalion during the MexicanAmerican War. Speaking about his ancestry, lvarez once said, ""There might have been an Irish grandfather somewhere back in my past.""
He was bullied at an early age when he would be called ""Jcama con Chile"", which translates as jicama with chilli flakes  a popular snack in Mexico.

Amateur career
lvarez started boxing when he was around 13 years old, after watching his older brother Rigoberto debut as a professional boxer. In 2004, he won the silver medal at the Junior Mexican National Championships, held in Sinaloa. He became the 2005 Junior Mexican National Boxing Champion in Tuxtla Gutirrez, Chiapas, at the age of 15. His amateur record was 442 with 12 knockouts.

Professional career
Early career
lvarez turned professional at 15, shortly after his championship at the Junior Nationals, because his trainers at the time, father-and-son team Chepo and Eddy Reynoso, were unable to find suitable junior opponents for him. In his first 19 months as a professional, he knocked out eleven of his 13 documented opponents, all of whom were significantly older. However, the elder Reynoso stated in 2013 that lvarez had fought ten more times in that span, winning all ten by knockout (KO), but that these fights (all in small venues in the Mexican state of Nayarit) were so poorly documented that it was not worth the trouble to seek to have the record corrected. This means that his actual record is 6722 with 49 knockouts. His weight fluctuated in his three years as a professional including two documented fights within the light welterweight limit of 140 lbs before he settled in the welterweight division at 147 lbs.lvarez's third official bout of his career was a win over future IBF lightweight champion Miguel Vzquez on 20 January 2006, in his home town of Guadalajara, Jalisco. On 28 June 2008, lvarez defeated Vzquez again in a rematch. He also made world history on that fight card when he and all six of his brothers fought on the same night, with Canelo being the youngest. The only downside was that three of them failed to win their pro debuts. The other four more experienced brothers won. On 6 March 2010, he got a crushing third-round KO over Brian Camechis in Tuxtla Gutirrez, Chiapas. lvarez then defeated Jos Cotto on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Shane Mosley to retain his WBC-NABF welterweight title.

Light middleweight
His sixth-round technical knockout (TKO) win over Luciano Leonel Cuello for the WBC Silver light middleweight title was held at the Vicente Fernndez Arena. During the post-fight interview, Mexican singer Vicente Fernndez gave lvarez a horse. He was also given a horse by the mayor of Tepic, where lvarez sometimes trains.He next faced the former WBC welterweight champion Carlos Baldomir at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, on the Shane Mosley vs. Sergio Mora undercard. Baldomir stated in a pre-fight interview that he wanted the winner of Mora vs. Mosley, as he said ""after I knock out El Canelo."" Baldomir weighed in at 153.4 lbs for the bout, that was contracted for 151 lbs. In California, if a fighter is overweight he is penalized 20% of his purse and that percent is given to the other fighter. However, lvarez declined to take the extra $12,000 from Baldomir. In the sixth round, lvarez landed a crushing blow that knocked Baldomir out cold. With the victory, lvarez became just the second boxer ever to stop Carlos Baldomir and the first boxer ever to knock him out. lvarez then successfully defended his light middleweight title by unanimous decision against former world champion Lovemore N'dou in Veracruz. It was a competitive fight despite the wide margins on the official scorecards of 119109, 120108, and 120108.
lvarez was in line as mandatory challenger for the winner of the vacant WBC light middleweight title bout between Manny Pacquiao and Antonio Margarito, however, Pacquiao who was the victor, wrote to the WBC stating he had no intention of defending the title and it was declared vacant. On 5 March 2011, lvarez defeated European welterweight champion Matthew Hatton via unanimous decision, for the vacant WBC light middleweight belt. The bout was televised on HBO and took place at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. lvarez was docked a point in the seventh round, which was uniformly scored 99, for hitting after the break. All three ringside judges scored the bout 119108 in favor of lvarez, who landed 47% of his 626 punches, including 53% of his power shots. Hatton connected with just 25% of his 546 total blows in a fight that averaged 1.4 million viewers on HBO.lvarez successfully defended his newly awarded WBC title against #4 ranked Ring light middleweight and current European light middleweight champion Ryan Rhodes. lvarez defeated Rhodes via TKO in the twelfth round on 18 June 2011, in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The fight averaged 1.6 million viewers on HBO.On 17 September 2011, lvarez successfully defended that same WBC title against The Contender competitor Alfonso Gmez at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, winning via TKO in the sixth round. Gmez won a majority of the first five rounds after lvarez knocked him down in the first round. lvarez was looking for one shot and got it in the sixth round when he backed Gmez up with a right hand. He then followed up with a flurry to get the referee to jump in and stop the fight.

lvarez vs. Cintrn
lvarez defeated Kermit Cintrn via TKO in the fifth round. lvarez spent the first three rounds feeling out his opponent Cintrn, a former welterweight champion, before punishing the Puerto Rican with body shots and straight right hands in the fourth round. He knocked Cintrn down once and had him in trouble at the end of the round, but Cintrn was saved by the bell. In the fifth round, Cintrn came out and caught lvarez with some combinations, but lvarez eventually overpowered him with several powerful straight right hands and the referee stepped in and stopped it. The fight averaged 1.5 million viewers on HBO: Boxing After Dark.

lvarez vs. Mosley
Richard Schaefer announced that lvarez's next bout would co-feature on the undercard of Miguel Cotto's clash with Floyd Mayweather Jr. at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. On 11 February 2012, Shane Mosley was announced as lvarez's next opponent in May for his WBC light middleweight title. lvarez defeated Mosley via unanimous decision after twelve rounds.

lvarez vs. Lpez
lvarez was originally set to fight top ten Ring light middleweight and former welterweight champion Paul Williams on 15 September 2012. However, on 27 May 2012, a motorcycle accident in the U.S. state of Georgia paralyzed Williams from the waist down, ending his boxing career. lvarez's possible opponents for his September bout were James Kirkland, Austin Trout, Delvin Rodriguez and most notably, Victor Ortiz.
lvarez was scheduled to defend his title against former welterweight titlist Victor Ortiz in the main event of a Showtime pay-per-view (PPV) card dubbed 'Knockout Kings' at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. However, on 23 June, Ortiz was unable to defeat underdog Josesito Lpez in what was supposed to be a ""tune-up"" fight at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, losing due to referee stoppage (broken jaw) and cancelling his bout with lvarez as a result.
Due to this upset, Lpez was instead penciled in to face Canelo at the MGM Grand on 15 September, for lvarez's WBC light middleweight title. lvarez won the fight via fifth-round TKO after dominating Lpez from start to finish, staying undefeated and increasing his record of 4101. The fight averaged 1.04 million on Showtime. Canelo earned $2 million for the fight and Lpez a smaller amount of $212,500.

lvarez vs. Trout
His next fight took place on 20 April 2013, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas against Austin Trout. The fight was supposed to take place during Cinco de Mayo weekend as the co-main event to Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Robert Guerrero; however, due to a contract disagreement between lvarez and Mayweather regarding their potential fight on 14 September 2013, lvarez opted to headline his own card instead.In front of 39,247 fans, lvarez successfully defended his WBC light middleweight title and won both the WBA (Regular) and vacant Ring light middleweight titles. During the first few rounds, Trout seemed to have a good game plan. However, lvarez's power took over after the third round, eventually scoring a knockdown in the seventh round to give Trout the first knockdown of his career. lvarez set up the knockdown with a pawing left jab, followed by the straight right hand. The fight was closer than expected, but lvarez still managed to dominate Trout throughout the fight with impressive head movement and shocking power. All three judges' scorecards were in favor of lvarez with a fair margin 115112 from Filipino judge Rey Danseco, 116111 from Texas' judge Oren Shellenberger, and 118109 from South African official Stanley Christodoulou. Although the last scorecard 118109 created controversy, the majority of sport analysts had lvarez winning by at least two points. CompuBox stats showed that Trout was the busier fighter, landing 154 of 769 punches thrown (20%) and lvarez was the more accurate puncher, landing 124 of his 431 thrown (29%). Immediately after the bout, Trout stated that he hadn't underestimated lvarez but that he trained to fight a completely different fighter.

lvarez vs. Mayweather
lvarez, Ring magazine's #1 ranked light middleweight and the unified WBA (Regular) and WBC champion, fought against Ring magazine's #1 pound-for-pound fighter, WBA (Super) light middleweight champion, WBC and Ring magazine welterweight champion, Floyd Mayweather Jr., on 14 September 2013. Mayweather held a world title at welterweight (147 lbs), but he also still owned a light middleweight title (154 lbs), which he won by outpointing Miguel Cotto in May 2012. He was moving back up in weight to face lvarez with their belts on the line, although the fight was contested at a catchweight of 152 lbs. The titles disputed for the bout were lvarez's WBC and Ring light middleweight titles and Mayweather's WBA (Super) light middleweight title. On fight night, Mayweather reportedly weighed 150 lbs and lvarez came in at 165 lbs.In front of a sold-out crowd of 16,746 at the MGM Garden, Mayweather defeated lvarez via majority decision. Judge C. J. Ross scored the fight 114114, a draw. Judge Dave Moretti had it 116112 and Craig Metcalfe scored it 117111. Judge Ross retired after this fight. Speaking of the controversial scorecard, Mayweather said, ""I can't control what the judges do."" CompuBox stats showed Mayweather's dominance in the fight. He landed 232 of 505 punches (46%) while lvarez connected on 117 of 526 thrown (22%). Mayweather earned a guaranteed $41.5 million to lvarez's $5 million.

Catchweight
lvarez vs. Angulo
On 9 January 2014, Golden Boy chief executive Richard Schaefer confirmed a deal had been made for a fight between lvarez and 31 year old Mexican boxer Alfredo Angulo (223, 18 KOs) to take place on 8 March 2014, on Showtime PPV at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. In March, ESPN reported the fight would take place at a catchweight of 155 lbs, due to lvarez not being able to make the light middleweight limit of 154 lbs. For the PPV fight, lvarez agreed to pay $100,000 of his minimum $1.25 million purse to Angulo, which would raise his purse $850,000. Also in the negotiations, lvarez agreed to weigh no more than 168 lbs on fight night. This was lvarez's first of five fights which took place at the 155-pound catchweight. On fight night, lvarez weighed 174 lbs on Showtime's scale and Angulo weighed 170 lbs. In front of 14,610 at the MGM, lvarez came out strong, throwing combinations. In a fairly lopsided beating, lvarez scored a tenth-round stoppage over Angulo punctuated by a lead left uppercut. The end of the fight began in round six, when Angulo's left eye started swelling. When the referee waived the fight off, the crowd was displeased and booed. At the time of stoppage, two judges had it 8982 and the third judge had it 8883, all in favor of lvarez.Angulo stated post-fight how he was unhappy with the stoppage, ""I told Tony he did the wrong job tonight. The referee tells us to take care of ourselves at all times. I can take care of myself. My plan was to work harder in the final four or three rounds. I had good preparation for this fight."" His trainer Virgil Hunter was also unhappy with referee Tony Weeks, ""I'm very upset. I told the referee and the doctor that if Canelo put two or three shots together that I would stop the fight. He landed one punch. Everyone knows Alfredo was coming on strong, everyone knows that.""

lvarez vs. Lara
lvarez fought Erislandy Lara on 12 July 2014, at the MGM Grand in a non-title match. Lara's WBA light middleweight title was not on the line, as the fight took place at a 155-pound catchweight and both fighters weighed in at precisely 155 lbs. lvarez rehydrated to 171 lbs while Lara came into the ring at 166 lbs. In a very close and competitive fight that went to a split decision, lvarez came out on top with two judges scoring 115113 in favor of each fighter and the final judge scoring 117111 in favor of lvarez. The final scorecard was controversial as many observers considered it far too wide. According to CompuBox, Lara landed 55 jabs to nine from lvarez, who landed the jab at a five percent connect rate. lvarez managed to land 88 power punches while Lara landed 53 power punches. Lara's clean punching, defense and movement were weighed against lvarez's effective aggressiveness and power punching. Lara came out in dominant fashion, utilizing a stick-and-move style and capturing the early rounds. Although lvarez struggled with Lara's one-two combinations, Lara's punches weren't thrown with sufficient power or frequency to dissuade him from consistently pressing the fight against a retreating Lara, and he was able to hammer away to Lara's body when he had him on the ropes. Lara's lead hand played a huge role in his one-two combination's effectiveness, but his output dropped as the fight progressed and he became increasingly tentative. lvarez was able to cut Lara with a lead left uppercut in the seventh round. Although the decision remains controversial, any talk of a rematch in the future was dismissed by Oscar De La Hoya who went on to say, ""No one wants a rematch.""

lvarez vs. Kirkland
In January 2015, Oscar De La Hoya announced that lvarez and James Kirkland (321, 28 KOs) had agreed to fight each other although no date or venue was set, in a non-title light middleweight bout. The reason why the date was not set was due to the upcoming Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao fight not having an official date. In March, at the official press conference, the fight was announced to take place at the Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas on 9 May 2015, live on HBO, a week after the 2 May fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao. It marked the first fight of lvarez's lucrative HBO contract. In front of 31,588, lvarez defeated Kirkland via third-round KO. Kirkland came out aggressively, but lvarez wobbled him and scored a knockdown via straight right hand in round one. In the third round, a counter right uppercut sent Kirkland to the canvas. lvarez ended the fight with a jab to the body quickly followed by the right hand, creating the KO. lvarez landed 87 of 150 punches thrown (58%) and Kirkland landed 42 of 197 (21%). After the bout, Kirkland said, ""I did not know I was knocked out."" He was then taken to hospital to undergo a CT scan. The win for lvarez set up a mega PPV fight between himself and WBC middleweight champion Miguel Cotto. The fight drew an average of 2.146 million viewers on HBO and peaked at 2.296 million, the highest viewership for HBO in 2015.

lvarez vs. Cotto
On 21 November 2015, lvarez won the WBC, Ring and lineal middleweight titles with a unanimous decision victory over Miguel Cotto in front of a sold-out crowd of 11,274 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. The fight took place at a catchweight of 155 lbs at Cotto's request. Although Cotto gave a tremendous effort, moving nicely throughout the fight, the judges clearly went for lvarez's superior power and accuracy, with surprisingly wide scores of 117111, 119109, and 118110. ESPN.com had the fight much closer, but still scored it in favour of lvarez, 115113. According to CompuBox, lvarez landed 155 of 484 punches (32%) and Cotto landed 129 of 629 (21%), with lvarez landing the heavier blows and inflicting more damage. Two months after the fight, the WBC awarded lvarez the WBC Diamond middleweight title at their headquarters in Mexico.
According to HBO, the fight generated 900,000 buys on PPV, which equated to around $58 million in domestic revenue. This was the first time since 2002, that a PPV generated 900,000 which didn't include Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya. That bout was a heavyweight title fight between Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson.

lvarez vs. Khan
In early 2016, it was announced that British boxer Amir Khan was moving up two weight divisions to fight lvarez at middleweight for his WBC, Ring and lineal middleweight titles. The fight took place on 7 May 2016, at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bout was on HBO PPV. Khan kept his distance in the first five rounds, using his speed to come in and step out which initially caused trouble for lvarez. In round six, lvarez landed a devastating right hand that knocked out Khan. The fight generated a live gate of $7,417,350, according to figures released by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). That total came from 13,072 tickets sold, far short of a sell out. The lvarezKhan gross places it 34th-best in Nevada history. The fight drew close to 600,000 PPV buys.After the fight, lvarez and his team invited middleweight champion Gennady ""GGG"" Golovkin into the ring to promote a future fight between them. During the post-fight interview with HBO's Max Kellerman, lvarez stated, ""Let's fight now."" On 18 May 2016, lvarez vacated the WBC title he defended in fighting Khan. The WBC immediately awarded the title to Gennady Golovkin.

Return to light middleweight
lvarez vs. Liam Smith
On 24 June, it was announced that lvarez was to drop the extra pound to 154 and challenge 27 year old WBO champion Liam Smith (2301, 13 KOs) from England on 17 September 2016, in the main event of a card on HBO PPV. On 18 July, Golden Boy Promotions announced the bout would take place at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, after the MGM Grand in Las Vegas was the other venue looking to host the fight. Having fought his last five fights at his preferred 155-pound catchweight, Canelo said, ""I am very pleased to announce my next fight against Liam Smith, a tremendous fighter with real knockout power, and the WBO light middleweight world title owner, I have no doubt that this fight will be give and take, which will fill the expectations of the fans, and I will work with all the enthusiasm as I always do to get the upper hand on Sept. 17.""In front of a record breaking crowd of 51,240, lvarez regained a world title at light middleweight following a devastating left hook to the body in round nine. Smith was also knocked down once in round seven and once in round eight, in a fight where lvarez was in control from the opening bell. lvarez landed 157 punches from 422 thrown with a connect rate of 37%, compared to Smith landing 115 from 403 thrown, a connect rate of 29%. The fight drew an estimate of 300,000 PPV buys.Golden Boy president Eric Gomez spoke to Ring magazine in December, stating that lvarez had no immediate plans to vacate the WBO title and may fight in the first quarter of 2017 at 154, defending his world title. He also stated that there were still plans for lvarez to fight Golovkin later in the year.

Return to catchweight
lvarez vs. Chvez Jr.
Following Julio Csar Chvez Jr.'s comeback win against Dominik Britsch in December 2016, he claimed he was back and ready to fight Golovkin at 168 lbs and lvarez at a 164-pound catchweight. Negotiations began soon after for a potential HBO PPV fight to take place in 2017 on Cinco de Mayo weekend, as there was interest from both sides that a fight take place. De La Hoya said a fight with Golovkin would still be likely for September 2017. Golden Boy president Eric Gomez confirmed a catchweight of 165 lbs was agreed between both sides. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman was on board, saying he would likely get his organisation involved in the bout and that it was a ""very attractive fight."" On 18 December, Julio Csar Chvez Sr. spoke about the ongoing negotiations, saying Golden Boy were offering his son a small amount for the potential big PPV fight. He went on to claim his son was offered a $5 million purse with no mention he would get a cut of the PPV revenue, a counter offer was submitted. A rematch clause was also discussed, which Chvez Jr. and his team had no problem with. Chvez Sr. went on to admit that he was fully aware lvarez is the A-side in the fight and would settle for no less than 3035% of the full revenue.On 22 December, the WBO made lvarez the mandatory challenger to the middleweight title, skipping the previous number one Avtandil Khurtsidze, which was considered controversial due to lvarez currently not fighting at middleweight. Khurtsidze, who had ten days to appeal decision, decided not to. On 24 December, lvarez and his team gave Chvez Jr. a week to accept the terms, which included a purse of $7 million, or he would consider other options. On 12 January 2017, De La Hoya and lvarez called for the contract to be signed, which was supposedly sent to Al Haymon, who advises Chvez Jr. and urged him to sign it. A day later, Chvez Jr. claimed he had agreed to all the demands set by lvarez and said that he would sign the contract. According to Chvez Jr., the new demands included a weight limit set at 164.5 lbs and a $6 million base purse, plus PPV revenue percentages.On 13 January, lvarez officially confirmed the fight to take place on 6 May 2017. A rematch clause was also put in place if Chvez Jr. wins the fight and another clause for every pound Chvez Jr. weighs over the limit, he would be fined $1 million. On 4 February, Golden Boy Promotions announced that the fight would take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada. On 22 February, lvarez announced that he planned on vacating his WBO light middleweight title following the Chvez Jr. fight and fighting at middleweight. On 3 March, The fight was announced a sell out on with 20,000 tickets being sold after they initially went on sale to the public on 20 February. On 11 April, lvarez spoke to boxing reporters in a teleconference and said that he would fight as a 160-pound middleweight after the Chvez Jr. fight.According to the NSAC, it was reported that lvarez would earn $5 million and Chvez Jr. would earn $3 million before any shares of PPV. The figures would increase based on PPV sales.In front of a sold-out crowd of 20,510, lvarez won the fight in dominant fashion via a shutout unanimous decision. All three judges scored it 120108 for lvarez. Chvez Jr. was very cautious throughout the fight. At times, he came forward and also had lvarez against the ropes, but failed to throw any punches. This led to jeers from the crowd in the later rounds due to a lack of action. lvarez spoke to HBO's Max Kellerman in the post-fight interview, talking about his fighting style, ""Tonight, I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things. I thought I was going to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn't do it. I've shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings, I've shown I can showcase myself."" CompuBox stats showed that lvarez landed 228 of 604 his punches thrown (38%) and Chvez Jr. landed 71 of 302 (24%). By the end of round five, lvarez landed 102 punches compared to Chvez Jr.'s 25 landed. Early figures revealed that the fight generated at least one million buys. A replay was shown on regular HBO a week later and drew an average of 769,000 viewers. This was the first boxing match to generate over a million PPV buys that didn't include Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya since 2002, which saw Lennox Lewis retain his heavyweight world titles against Mike Tyson. Later sources confirmed the fight did close to 1.2 million buys, which means it would have generated around $80 million.

Middleweight
lvarez vs. Golovkin
Immediately after the Chvez Jr. fight, lvarez announced that he would next fight Gennady Golovkin on 16 September 2017, at a location to be determined. Golovkin, who stated he would not attend the fight, was joined by his trainer Abel Sanchez and promoter Tom Loeffler. Golovkin joined him in the ring during the announcement to help promote their upcoming bout. Speaking through a translator, lvarez said, ""Golovkin, you are next, my friend. The fight is done. I've never feared anyone, since I was 15 fighting as a professional. When I was born, fear was gone."" When Golovkin arrived in the ring, he said, ""I feel very excited. Right now is a different story. In September, it will be a different style  a big drama show. I'm ready. Tonight, first congrats to Canelo and his team. Right now, I think everyone is excited for September. Canelo looked very good tonight, and 100 percent he is the biggest challenge of my career. Good luck to Canelo in September.""On 9 May, Eric Gomez, president of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that lvarez had an immediate rematch clause in place on his contract, whereas Golovkin, if he loses, won't be guaranteed a rematch. De La Hoya later revealed in an interview with ESPN that the fight would also take place at the full middleweight limit of 160 lbs with no rehydration clauses, meaning Golovkin and lvarez would be able to gain an unlimited amount of weight following the weigh in. On 5 June, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue of the fight and would mark the first time Golovkin would fight in the state of Nevada. The AT&T Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodgers Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions said in a statement that lvarez would fight for the IBF title, meaning he would participate in the second day weigh in where the IBF requires that each boxer weighs no more than ten lbs over the 160-pound limit. Although he said there was no word on whether lvarez would fight for the WBC title, lvarez claimed that he would not be. On 7 July 2017, Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out.On 15 August, Golden Boy matchmaker Robert Diaz revealed that lvarez would indeed attend the IBF mandatory second day weigh in and fully intended to fight for both the IBF title and the WBA title. He also made it clear that whilst Golovkin would still defend the WBC and IBO title, lvarez would not pay their sanctioning fees. On 22 August, IBF president Daryl Peoples announced that they would be dropping the mandatory second day weigh in for unification fights, meaning neither fighter is required to participate, however they would still encourage them to do so. It was reported that lvarez would earn a base minimum $5 million and Golovkin would earn $3 million, before any shares of the revenue are added to their purses.On fight night, in front of a sold-out crowd of 22,358, Golovkin and lvarez fought to a split draw (118110 lvarez, 115113 Golovkin, and 114114). ESPN's Dan Rafael and HBO's Harold Lederman scored the fight 116112 in favor of Golovkin. Judge Adalaide Byrd's scorecard of 118110 in favor of lvarez was widely ridiculed. Many observers felt that Golovkin had won a narrow, closely contested fight and while a draw was justifiable, a card that wide in favor of lvarez was inexcusable. Nevertheless, Bob Bennett, director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, said that he had full confidence in Byrd going forward. Despite the controversy, several mainstream media outlets referred to the bout as a ""classic"". The fight started with both boxers finding their rhythm, lvarez using his footwork and Golovkin establishing his jab. During the middle rounds, particularly between four and eight, lvarez started each round quickly, but seemed to tire out after a minute, with Golovkin taking over and doing enough to win the rounds. The championship rounds were arguably the best rounds and lvarez started to counter more and both fighters stood toe-to-toe exchanging swings, the majority of which missed. The draw saw Golovkin make his 19th consecutive defense, just one behind middleweight great Bernard Hopkins. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin was the busier of the two, landing 218 of 703 thrown (31%), while lvarez was more accurate, landing 169 of his 505 thrown (34%). Golovkin out landed lvarez in ten of the twelve rounds. The replay, which took place a week later on HBO averaged 726,000, peaking at 840,000 viewers.Speaking to Max Kellerman after the fight, Golovkin said, ""It was a big drama show. [The scoring] is not my fault. I put pressure on him every round. Look, I still have all the belts. I am still the champion."" lvarez felt as though he won the fight, ""In the first rounds, I came out to see what he had. Then I was building from there. I think I won eight rounds. I felt that I won the fight. I think I was superior in the ring. I won at least seven or eight rounds. I was able to counterpunch and made Gennady wobble at least three times. If we fight again, it's up to the people. I feel frustrated over my draw."" Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez believed judge Byrd had her scorecard filled out before the first bell rang. lvarez ruled out another fight in 2017, claiming he would return on Cinco de Mayo weekend in May 2018. At the post-fight press conference, lvarez said through a translator, ""Look, right now I wanna rest. Whatever the fans want, whatever the people want and ask for, we'll do. You know that's my style. But right now, who knows if it's in May or September? But one thing's for sure  this is my era, the era of Canelo"". Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler stated that they would like an immediate rematch, but Golovkin, who prefers fighting at least three times in a calendar year, reiterated his desire to also fight in December.
The fight surpassed Mayweatherlvarez to achieve the third highest gate in boxing history. ESPN reported the fight generated $27,059,850 from 17,318 tickets sold. 934 complimentary tickets were given out, according to the NSAC.

lvarez vs. Golovkin II
Immediately after the controversial ending, talks began for a rematch between lvarez and Golovkin. lvarez stated he would next fight in May 2018, whereas Golovkin was open to fighting in December 2017. ESPN reported that lvarez, who only had the rematch clause in his contract, must activate it within three weeks of their fight. On 19 September, Golden Boy Promotions president Eric Gomez told ESPN that everyone on their side was interested in the rematch and they would hold discussions with Tom Loeffler in the coming days. Ringtv reported that the negotiations would begin on 22 September. On 24 September, Gomez said the rematch would likely take place in the first week of May 2018 or as early as March if a deal could be worked. Despite ongoing negotiations for the rematch, at the 55th annual convention in Baku, Azerbaijan on 2 October, the WBC officially ordered a rematch. Gomez reacted by telling ESPN, ""Regardless of if they did or didn't order the rematch, we are going to try to make it happen. We'll do whatever it takes to make it happen."" On 7 November, Gomez indicated the negotiations were going well and lvarez would make a decision in regards to the rematch in the following weeks. It was believed that Golden Boy would wait until after David Lemieux and Billy Joe Saunders fought for the latter's WBO title on 16 December 2017, before making a decision. On 15 November, Matchroom's Eddie Hearn, promoter of Daniel Jacobs, stated that he approached Tom Loeffler regarding a possible rematch between Golovkin and Jacobs if the lvarezGolovkin rematch failed to take place. On 20 December, Gomez announced that the negotiations were close to being finalized after lvarez gave Golden Boy the go-ahead to write up the contracts. On 29 January 2018, HBO finally announced the rematch would take place in May on Cinco de Mayo weekend. On 22 February, the T-Mobile Arena was again selected as the fight's venue. According to WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman, lvarez would fight Golovkin for their title this time around.In March 2018, lvarez tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol ahead of the fight. Adding to the controversy, Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez claimed that lvarez had his hands wrapped in an illegal manner for the first fight. On 23 March, the NSAC temporarily suspended lvarez due to his two positive tests for the banned substance clenbuterol. lvarez was required to appear at a commission hearing, either in person or via telephone, on the issue on 10 April. The commission would decide at the hearing whether the fight would be permitted to go ahead as scheduled. On 28 March, MGM Resorts International, who own the T-Mobile Arena, started to offer full refunds to anyone who had already purchased tickets for the bout. They wrote, ""In the event a fan requested a refund, they could get one at the original point of sale and in full."" The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported the news. The hearing was rescheduled for 18 April, as Bob Bennett filed a complaint against lvarez. On 3 April, lvarez officially withdrew from the rematch. Golden Boy mentioned during a press conference it was hinted that lvarez would likely not be cleared at the hearing and they would not have enough time to promote the fight.On 13 April, an unofficial source stated that lvarez had checked into a private hospital in Guadalajara for an arthroscopy knee surgery. A spokesperson for Golden Boy later said it was a cosmetic surgery. After surgery, lvarez posted a picture on social media with a caption reading, ""I share that today I had to undergo an arthroscopic surgery to repair the internal femoral cartilage and eliminate a pathological fold of my right knee."" Eric Gomez of Golden Boy later confirmed that lvarez had ""a cyst taken out of his knee"" and there were no serious issues with his knee.At the hearing, lvarez was given a six-month suspension, backdated to his first drug test fail on 17 February, meaning the ban would end on 17 August 2018. The Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) stated that lvarez was not enrolled in their testing program. His promoter De La Hoya then announced that lvarez would return to the ring on Mexican Independence Day weekend.According to Golovkin on 27 April, before he defeated Vanes Martirosyan, a fight with lvarez in the fall was still a priority. During a conference call, he stated it was the ""biggest fight in the world"" and beneficial for all parties involved. Although Golovkin stated the rematch had a ten percent chance of happening, Eric Gomez and Tom Loeffler agreed to meet and start negotiating after 5 May. One of the main issues preventing the rematch to take place was the purse split. lvarez wanted 6535 in his favor, the same terms Golovkin agreed to initially, however Golovkin wanted a straight 5050 split.On 6 June, Golovkin was stripped of his IBF title due to not adhering to the IBF's rules. The IBF granted Golovkin an exception to fight Martirosyan, although they would not sanction the fight and told Golovkin's team to start negotiating and fight mandatory challenger Sergiy Derevyanchenko by 3 August 2018. The IBF released a statement in detail explaining its decision to strip Golovkin of the belt. On 7 June, Golovkin's team stated they would accept a 5545 split in favor of lvarez. Five days later on 12 June, Golden Boy gave Golovkin a 24-hour deadline to accept a 5742 split in lvarez's favor or they would explore other fights. At this time, Golden Boy were already in light negotiations with Eddie Hearn for a fight against Daniel Jacobs instead. At the same time, Loeffler was working closely with Frank Warren to match Saunders with Golovkin at the end of August. Golovkin declined the offer and De La Hoya stated there would be no rematch. Despite this, some sources indicated both sides were still negotiating after a ""Hail Mary"" idea came to light. Hours later, De La Hoya confirmed via his Twitter account that terms had been agreed and the fight would indeed take place on 15 September at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Golovkin revealed to ESPN he agreed to 45%. lvarez started training for the bout on 14 June and stated his intention to apply for his boxing license on 18 August. It was confirmed that both boxers would not physically come face to face with each other until the fight week. A split-screen press conference took place on 3 July. On 3 September, due to a majority vote of the panel, it was announced that the vacant Ring middleweight title would be contested for the bout. Doug Fischer wrote, ""We posed the question to the ratings panel, which, in a landslide, voted in favor the magazine's 160-pound championship being up for grabs when the two stars clash at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.""In front of a sell out crowd of 21,965, the fight was again not without controversy as lvarez defeated Golovkin via majority decision after twelve rounds. lvarez was favored by judges Dave Moretti and Steve Weisfeld, both scoring the bout 115113, the third judge Glenn Feldman scored it 114114. The result was disputed by fans, pundits and media. Of the 18 media outlets scoring the bout, ten ruled in favor of Golovkin, seven scored a draw while one scored the bout for lvarez. The scorecards showed how close the bout was, with the judges splitting eight rounds. After nine rounds, all three judges had their scorecards reading 8784 for lvarez.The fight was much different from the first bout in terms of action. lvarez who was described by Golovkin's team as a ""runner"", altered his style and became more aggressive. Both boxers found use of their respective jabs from the opening round with Golovkin using his jab more as the fight went on. Big punches were landed by both fighters during the bout, with both lvarez and Golovkin showing excellent chins. Despite the tense build up, both boxers showed each other respect after the fight. lvarez made good use of his body attack, landing 46 compared to Golovkin's six landed. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin landed 234 of 879 punches thrown (27%) and lvarez landed 202 of his 622 punches (33%). Golovkin had the edge in jabs, landing 118 out of 547 (21.6%) compared to 59 out of 256 (23%) for lvarez. However, lvarez had the edge in power punches, landing 143 out of 366 (39.1%) compared to 116 out of 332 (34.9%) for Golovkin. In eight of the rounds Golovkin outlanded lvarez in total punches whereas lvarez outlanded him in power punches in 9 of the rounds.lvarez stated that the fight was a ""clear victory"" and that ""in the end, it was a victory for Mexico. And again, it was an opportunity. And I want to shout out to my opponent, the best in the sport of boxing. I am a great fighter, and I showed it tonight. If the people want another round, I'll do it again. But for right now, I will enjoy time with my family."" Golovkin did not take part in the post-fight and made his way backstage where he received stitches for a cut over his right eye. He later responded to the defeat, explaining that ""I'm not going to say who won tonight, because the victory belongs to Canelo, according to the judges. I thought it was a very good fight for the fans and very exciting. I thought I fought better than he did."" Both fighters were open to a trilogy.The fight generated a live gate of $23,473,500 from 16,732 tickets sold. This was lower than the first bout, but still the fourth largest-grossing gates in Nevada boxing history. The fight sold 1.1 million PPV buys, lower than the first bout; however, due to being priced at $84.95, it generated more revenue at around $94 million.

Super middleweight
lvarez vs. Fielding
In October 2018, lvarez announced that he would move up to the super middleweight division for the first time in his career to fight 31-year-old British boxer Rocky Fielding (271, 15 KOs) at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York on 15 December 2018, for the WBA (Regular) super middleweight title. On 17 October 2018, DAZN announced that it had signed a five-year, $365 million deal with lvarez, under which his next eleven fights would be broadcast in the U.S. by the subscription sports streaming service. The deal would begin with lvarez vs. Fielding and replace his expired contract with HBO (which had also announced its discontinuation of boxing telecasts). lvarez won the one-sided bout via third-round technical knockout after repeatedly downing Fielding with body shots. Following the fourth knockdown suffered by Fielding, referee Ricky Gonzalez stopped the match.

lvarez vs. Jacobs
lvarez defeated IBF middleweight champion Daniel Jacobs via unanimous decision, 115113, 115113, 116112, on 4 May 2019, in a unification bout at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. lvarez defended his WBA (Super), WBC, Ring and lineal middleweight titles whilst obtaining Jacobs' IBF middleweight title.

Light heavyweight
lvarez vs. Kovalev
On 13 September 2019, lvarez announced via social media that he would move up two weight classes to challenge WBO light heavyweight titleholder Sergey Kovalev on 2 November 2019, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. After a competitive first ten rounds in which Kovalev found success with his jab while lvarez largely utilized power punches, the latter produced a left hook, straight right combination to stop Kovalev in the eleventh round to become a four-division world champion. At the time of the stoppage, lvarez led 9694 on two of the judges' scorecards, with the other scorecard even at 9595. He joined Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Mike McCallum as the only former junior middleweight champions in history to win a title at light heavyweight. Among them, only Hearns, Leonard, and Alvarez himself established their careers at welterweight and claimed the title at the 175 pound limit.After the fight, Kovalev suggested that he had always been unlikely to win the fight, due to the grueling schedule of back-to-back training camps which resulted from the short period of time between fighting Anthony Yarde on 24 August and lvarez on 2 November, but he had agreed to fight the latter regardless due to the high financial incentive, reported to be $12 million. lvarez himself was reported to have received a purse of $35 million for the fight. lvarez responded by calling Kovalev a ""bad loser"".For his 2019 campaign, lvarez was named the fighter of the year by The Ring Magazine, ESPN, Sports Illustrated, and the Boxing Writers Association of America.

Return to super middleweight
On 6 November 2020, lvarez was released from his contract with Golden Boy Promotions after a lawsuit was settled for breach of contract.

lvarez vs. Callum Smith
On 17 November via social media, lvarez announced he would be facing undefeated WBA (Super) and The Ring super middleweight champion Callum Smith on 19 December 2020, with the vacant WBC title also at stake. The fight was held at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. lvarez's trainer Eddy Reynoso revealed that his fighter had been sparring with undefeated heavyweight Frank Snchez in preparation for the bout. On the night, lvarez controlled the action over twelve rounds, inflicting Smith with a detached left biceps injury as he won by unanimous decision with scores of 119109, 119109, 117111.

lvarez vs. Yldrm
It was announced on 20 January 2021 that lvarez would be defending his titles against WBC mandatory challenger Avni Yldrm on 27 February at the Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida. The bout attracted criticism due to many perceiving Yldrm, who had not been in the ring since he lost a technical split decision to Anthony Dirrell two years prior in February 2019, to be vastly over-matched. Yldrm had been named to the mandatory position as a result of the controversial nature of his loss to Dirrell, however, he had remained sidelined due to injury and the COVID-19 pandemic. lvarez, who was mandated to face Yldrm in order to retain the WBC title despite being heavily favored, was dismissive of the critics, saying ""I really don't have to give any explanation because they're never gonna be happy with anything... He [Yldrm] has lots of courage. He can be dangerous at any moment because he is a strong fighter.""In a one-sided fight, lvarez defeated Yldrm by third-round corner retirement after Yldrm's corner threw in the towel at the end of the third round. According to CompuBox stats, lvarez outlanded Yldrm 67 (40%) to 11 (11%) in total punches and 58 (59%) to 4 (22%) in power punches. In the third round, lvarez threw 53 power punches. lvarez later stated that he had contracted COVID-19 prior to the fight and only had one month to train.

lvarez vs. Saunders
After lvarez's successful defense against Avni Yldrm, promoter Eddie Hearn confirmed lvarez would be facing WBO titleholder and undefeated two-weight world champion Billy Joe Saunders in a unification bout on May 8 at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Prior to the fight, there was a dispute between the two fighters' camps regarding the size of the ring: Saunders was unhappy with the proposed 18-foot ring. He instead wanted a 24-foot ring and threatened to pull out of the fight if his request wasn't met, despite having boxed primarily in 20-foot rings in his bouts in the past in the United Kingdom. He ultimately settled for a 22-foot ring after lvarez said, ""I don't care about the size of the ring, I'm just gonna go in there and do my job. It's not the only excuse he's had. He's had plenty of excuses,"" referencing when Saunders had previously voiced his concerns about the selection of judges for the fight.In front of a record breaking crowd of 73,126 for boxing attendance at an indoor facility in the United States, lvarez won via eighth-round corner retirement when Saunders' team threw in the towel due to Saunders having suffered a fractured orbital bone as a result of an uppercut landed by lvarez. At the time of the stoppage, lvarez was winning on the scorecards 7874 (twice) and 7775. Throughout the fight, lvarez outlanded Saunders 73 to 60 in total punches and landed 53% of his power punches.In the immediate post-fight press conference, lvarez was confronted by undefeated WBO middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade who asked him when they were going to fight, before accusing lvarez of ducking him. lvarez responded to him in English dismissively, calling him a ""horrible fighter"", and criticizing his resume: ""Man, you fight with nobody. You are a champion but you fight with nobody."" Before Andrade was removed from the press conference, lvarez told him, ""Get the fuck outta here. Please, get the fuck outta here. Get the fuck outta here because I'm gonna fuck you up right now motherfucker.""

lvarez vs. Plant
After months of negotiations, lvarez announced on his social media on 19 August 2021 that he would be facing undefeated IBF champion Caleb Plant on 6 November at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, in an undisputed showdown for all four major world titles in the super middleweight division, with the winner set to become the first ever undisputed champion at that weight class. On 21 September 2021, the two fighters were engaged in a brief onstage scuffle during their first press conference, in which lvarez initiated physical contact during their face-off when he shoved Plant. lvarez stated that he had done this because he took offense to Plant's use of the word ""motherfucker"", interpreting it as an insult to his mother. Plant denied to reporters that he had used the common American curse word in that context. Moreover, he drew attention to lvarez's hypocrisy, accurately indicating that lvarez had previously used the same slur against Demetrius Andrade on the night of 8 May 2021 in the aftermath of his fight against Billy Joe Saunders in Arlington, Texas.On fight night, lvarez won the bout via eleventh-round technical knockout. He had knocked his opponent to the canvas with a left hook right uppercut combination in the penultimate round, before closing in to drop Plant again, prompting referee Russell Mora to call off the bout. At the time of the stoppage, lvarez was ahead on the scorecards with 9892, 9694, and 9793. With this win, he became only the sixth fighter to unify all belts in one division in the four-belt era.

Return to light heavyweight
lvarez vs. Bivol
At the WBC Convention on 15 November 2021 in Mexico City, the WBC approved the request of lvarez's trainer and manager, Eddy Reynoso, to have lvarez challenge Ilunga Makabu for his WBC cruiserweight title. lvarez has never competed at cruiserweight, so Reynoso had needed to petition the WBC to order the title fight. The cruiserweight limit was 200 pounds, but it had recently been reduced to 190 pounds by the WBC due to the introduction of bridgerweight. The fight had been rumored to take place in May 2022. This ultimately did not materialize, as Makabu was forced into a mandatory defense of his title in a rematch against Thabiso Mchunu on 29 January 2022, which the former won via split decision. Instead, it was announced on 25 February 2022 that lvarez had signed a two-fight deal with Matchroom Boxing; the first fight would see him returning to the light heavyweight division to challenge undefeated WBA (Super) champion Dmitry Bivol on 7 May in a bout that would be televised as sports streaming service DAZN's first pay-per-view offering in the United States and Canada.In a surprise upset, all three judges scored the bout 115113 in Bivol's favor to hand lvarez the second defeat of his professional career. According to CompuBox punch statistics, Bivol had outlanded lvarez in every single round of the fight, for a total of 152 punches landed out of 710 thrown (21%), compared to lvarez's 84 of 495 (17%). Many media reporters and pundits drew attention to the judges' official scorecards: all three judges had scored lvarez the winner of the first four rounds, something that was roundly criticized, and described by ESPN reporter Mike Coppinger as ""puzzling"". Despite the widespread public opinion that Bivol was the deserved winner, lvarez disagreed with this notion, stating in his post-fight interview: ""I don't feel like I lost the fight... Personally, I felt he [Bivol] only won four or five rounds."" He went on to express his desire to fight Bivol again: ""We want the rematch, and we're going to do better in the rematch."" Despite this, a rematch between lvarez and Bivol did not materialize immediately, as the former opted to face WBA (Super) and IBF middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin in a trilogy bout as his opponent for his next fight instead.

Return to super middleweight
lvarez vs. Golovkin III
Despite lvarez expressing his desire to avenge his loss against WBA (Super) light heavyweight champion Dmitry Bivol in a rematch, on 24 May 2022 it was announced that lvarez would instead be returning to the super middleweight division to defend his undisputed titles against Gennady Golovkin in a trilogy bout on 17 September. The bout would see Golovkin, the WBA (Super) and IBF middleweight champion, compete in the super middleweight division for the first time in his career, while it was lvarez's sixth bout in the same weight class.In the first pre-fight press conference on 25 June 2022 in Los Angeles, lvarez described the rivalry between him and Golovkin as ""personal"" rather than simply competitive. lvarez stated of his opponent: ""He always pretends to be a nice guy but he's an asshole. He's an asshole person... He's talking a lot of things about me. That's why it's personal."" lvarez went on to express his excitement at the prospect of sending his opponent into retirement, and admitted that he received gratification from making Golovkin wait four years for a trilogy bout on his own terms, in his preferred weight class of super middleweight: ""It makes me feel good.""On fight night, lvarez defeated Golovkin via unanimous decision with the scores of 115113 (twice) and 116112.

lvarez vs. Ryder
On 14 March 2023, it was announced that lvarez would be making the second defense of his undisputed super middleweight titles against WBO interim champion John Ryder at Estadio Akron in his hometown of Guadalajara, Mexico on 6 May. The bout would mark lvarez's first bout in his home nation in over eleven years.lvarez won via unanimous decision after the judges scored the fight 118109 (twice) and 120107 in his favor after 12 rounds.

Early life
In an interview, lvarez explained that he was born on the outskirts of Guadalajara, Jalisco, but his family is originally from Los Reyes, Michoacn. At the age of five, his family moved to their current home of Juanacatln, Jalisco. Growing up on his family's farm, he learned horseback riding, which he continues today. lvarez is the youngest of eight children, seven of them boys; all of his brothers also became professional boxers. Among his brothers are welterweight boxers Ramn lvarez, Ricardo lvarez and former WBA interim world champion, Rigoberto lvarez.Canelo in Spanish is the masculine word for cinnamon, which is a common nickname for people with red hair. His mother, Ana Maria, also has red hair. In Mexico, it is common for people to associate red hair with the Irish soldiers who fought for Mexico in the Saint Patrick's Battalion during the MexicanAmerican War. Speaking about his ancestry, lvarez once said, ""There might have been an Irish grandfather somewhere back in my past.""
He was bullied at an early age when he would be called ""Jcama con Chile"", which translates as jicama with chilli flakes  a popular snack in Mexico.

Amateur career
lvarez started boxing when he was around 13 years old, after watching his older brother Rigoberto debut as a professional boxer. In 2004, he won the silver medal at the Junior Mexican National Championships, held in Sinaloa. He became the 2005 Junior Mexican National Boxing Champion in Tuxtla Gutirrez, Chiapas, at the age of 15. His amateur record was 442 with 12 knockouts.

Professional career
Early career
lvarez turned professional at 15, shortly after his championship at the Junior Nationals, because his trainers at the time, father-and-son team Chepo and Eddy Reynoso, were unable to find suitable junior opponents for him. In his first 19 months as a professional, he knocked out eleven of his 13 documented opponents, all of whom were significantly older. However, the elder Reynoso stated in 2013 that lvarez had fought ten more times in that span, winning all ten by knockout (KO), but that these fights (all in small venues in the Mexican state of Nayarit) were so poorly documented that it was not worth the trouble to seek to have the record corrected. This means that his actual record is 6722 with 49 knockouts. His weight fluctuated in his three years as a professional including two documented fights within the light welterweight limit of 140 lbs before he settled in the welterweight division at 147 lbs.lvarez's third official bout of his career was a win over future IBF lightweight champion Miguel Vzquez on 20 January 2006, in his home town of Guadalajara, Jalisco. On 28 June 2008, lvarez defeated Vzquez again in a rematch. He also made world history on that fight card when he and all six of his brothers fought on the same night, with Canelo being the youngest. The only downside was that three of them failed to win their pro debuts. The other four more experienced brothers won. On 6 March 2010, he got a crushing third-round KO over Brian Camechis in Tuxtla Gutirrez, Chiapas. lvarez then defeated Jos Cotto on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Shane Mosley to retain his WBC-NABF welterweight title.

Light middleweight
His sixth-round technical knockout (TKO) win over Luciano Leonel Cuello for the WBC Silver light middleweight title was held at the Vicente Fernndez Arena. During the post-fight interview, Mexican singer Vicente Fernndez gave lvarez a horse. He was also given a horse by the mayor of Tepic, where lvarez sometimes trains.He next faced the former WBC welterweight champion Carlos Baldomir at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, on the Shane Mosley vs. Sergio Mora undercard. Baldomir stated in a pre-fight interview that he wanted the winner of Mora vs. Mosley, as he said ""after I knock out El Canelo."" Baldomir weighed in at 153.4 lbs for the bout, that was contracted for 151 lbs. In California, if a fighter is overweight he is penalized 20% of his purse and that percent is given to the other fighter. However, lvarez declined to take the extra $12,000 from Baldomir. In the sixth round, lvarez landed a crushing blow that knocked Baldomir out cold. With the victory, lvarez became just the second boxer ever to stop Carlos Baldomir and the first boxer ever to knock him out. lvarez then successfully defended his light middleweight title by unanimous decision against former world champion Lovemore N'dou in Veracruz. It was a competitive fight despite the wide margins on the official scorecards of 119109, 120108, and 120108.
lvarez was in line as mandatory challenger for the winner of the vacant WBC light middleweight title bout between Manny Pacquiao and Antonio Margarito, however, Pacquiao who was the victor, wrote to the WBC stating he had no intention of defending the title and it was declared vacant. On 5 March 2011, lvarez defeated European welterweight champion Matthew Hatton via unanimous decision, for the vacant WBC light middleweight belt. The bout was televised on HBO and took place at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. lvarez was docked a point in the seventh round, which was uniformly scored 99, for hitting after the break. All three ringside judges scored the bout 119108 in favor of lvarez, who landed 47% of his 626 punches, including 53% of his power shots. Hatton connected with just 25% of his 546 total blows in a fight that averaged 1.4 million viewers on HBO.lvarez successfully defended his newly awarded WBC title against #4 ranked Ring light middleweight and current European light middleweight champion Ryan Rhodes. lvarez defeated Rhodes via TKO in the twelfth round on 18 June 2011, in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The fight averaged 1.6 million viewers on HBO.On 17 September 2011, lvarez successfully defended that same WBC title against The Contender competitor Alfonso Gmez at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, winning via TKO in the sixth round. Gmez won a majority of the first five rounds after lvarez knocked him down in the first round. lvarez was looking for one shot and got it in the sixth round when he backed Gmez up with a right hand. He then followed up with a flurry to get the referee to jump in and stop the fight.

lvarez vs. Cintrn
lvarez defeated Kermit Cintrn via TKO in the fifth round. lvarez spent the first three rounds feeling out his opponent Cintrn, a former welterweight champion, before punishing the Puerto Rican with body shots and straight right hands in the fourth round. He knocked Cintrn down once and had him in trouble at the end of the round, but Cintrn was saved by the bell. In the fifth round, Cintrn came out and caught lvarez with some combinations, but lvarez eventually overpowered him with several powerful straight right hands and the referee stepped in and stopped it. The fight averaged 1.5 million viewers on HBO: Boxing After Dark.

lvarez vs. Mosley
Richard Schaefer announced that lvarez's next bout would co-feature on the undercard of Miguel Cotto's clash with Floyd Mayweather Jr. at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. On 11 February 2012, Shane Mosley was announced as lvarez's next opponent in May for his WBC light middleweight title. lvarez defeated Mosley via unanimous decision after twelve rounds.

lvarez vs. Lpez
lvarez was originally set to fight top ten Ring light middleweight and former welterweight champion Paul Williams on 15 September 2012. However, on 27 May 2012, a motorcycle accident in the U.S. state of Georgia paralyzed Williams from the waist down, ending his boxing career. lvarez's possible opponents for his September bout were James Kirkland, Austin Trout, Delvin Rodriguez and most notably, Victor Ortiz.
lvarez was scheduled to defend his title against former welterweight titlist Victor Ortiz in the main event of a Showtime pay-per-view (PPV) card dubbed 'Knockout Kings' at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. However, on 23 June, Ortiz was unable to defeat underdog Josesito Lpez in what was supposed to be a ""tune-up"" fight at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, losing due to referee stoppage (broken jaw) and cancelling his bout with lvarez as a result.
Due to this upset, Lpez was instead penciled in to face Canelo at the MGM Grand on 15 September, for lvarez's WBC light middleweight title. lvarez won the fight via fifth-round TKO after dominating Lpez from start to finish, staying undefeated and increasing his record of 4101. The fight averaged 1.04 million on Showtime. Canelo earned $2 million for the fight and Lpez a smaller amount of $212,500.

lvarez vs. Trout
His next fight took place on 20 April 2013, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas against Austin Trout. The fight was supposed to take place during Cinco de Mayo weekend as the co-main event to Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Robert Guerrero; however, due to a contract disagreement between lvarez and Mayweather regarding their potential fight on 14 September 2013, lvarez opted to headline his own card instead.In front of 39,247 fans, lvarez successfully defended his WBC light middleweight title and won both the WBA (Regular) and vacant Ring light middleweight titles. During the first few rounds, Trout seemed to have a good game plan. However, lvarez's power took over after the third round, eventually scoring a knockdown in the seventh round to give Trout the first knockdown of his career. lvarez set up the knockdown with a pawing left jab, followed by the straight right hand. The fight was closer than expected, but lvarez still managed to dominate Trout throughout the fight with impressive head movement and shocking power. All three judges' scorecards were in favor of lvarez with a fair margin 115112 from Filipino judge Rey Danseco, 116111 from Texas' judge Oren Shellenberger, and 118109 from South African official Stanley Christodoulou. Although the last scorecard 118109 created controversy, the majority of sport analysts had lvarez winning by at least two points. CompuBox stats showed that Trout was the busier fighter, landing 154 of 769 punches thrown (20%) and lvarez was the more accurate puncher, landing 124 of his 431 thrown (29%). Immediately after the bout, Trout stated that he hadn't underestimated lvarez but that he trained to fight a completely different fighter.

lvarez vs. Mayweather
lvarez, Ring magazine's #1 ranked light middleweight and the unified WBA (Regular) and WBC champion, fought against Ring magazine's #1 pound-for-pound fighter, WBA (Super) light middleweight champion, WBC and Ring magazine welterweight champion, Floyd Mayweather Jr., on 14 September 2013. Mayweather held a world title at welterweight (147 lbs), but he also still owned a light middleweight title (154 lbs), which he won by outpointing Miguel Cotto in May 2012. He was moving back up in weight to face lvarez with their belts on the line, although the fight was contested at a catchweight of 152 lbs. The titles disputed for the bout were lvarez's WBC and Ring light middleweight titles and Mayweather's WBA (Super) light middleweight title.

He landed 232 of 505 punches (46%) while lvarez connected on 117 of 526 thrown (22%). Mayweather earned a guaranteed $41.5 million to lvarez's $5 million.

Catchweight
lvarez vs. Angulo
On 9 January 2014, Golden Boy chief executive Richard Schaefer confirmed a deal had been made for a fight between lvarez and 31 year old Mexican boxer Alfredo Angulo (223, 18 KOs) to take place on 8 March 2014, on Showtime PPV at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. In March, ESPN reported the fight would take place at a catchweight of 155 lbs, due to lvarez not being able to make the light middleweight limit of 154 lbs. For the PPV fight, lvarez agreed to pay $100,000 of his minimum $1.25 million purse to Angulo, which would raise his purse $850,000. Also in the negotiations, lvarez agreed to weigh no more than 168 lbs on fight night. This was lvarez's first of five fights which took place at the 155-pound catchweight. On fight night, lvarez weighed 174 lbs on Showtime's scale and Angulo weighed 170 lbs. In front of 14,610 at the MGM, lvarez came out strong, throwing combinations. In a fairly lopsided beating, lvarez scored a tenth-round stoppage over Angulo punctuated by a lead left uppercut. The end of the fight began in round six, when Angulo's left eye started swelling. When the referee waived the fight off, the crowd was displeased and booed. At the time of stoppage, two judges had it 8982 and the third judge had it 8883, all in favor of lvarez.Angulo stated post-fight how he was unhappy with the stoppage, ""I told Tony he did the wrong job tonight. The referee tells us to take care of ourselves at all times. I can take care of myself. My plan was to work harder in the final four or three rounds. I had good preparation for this fight."" His trainer Virgil Hunter was also unhappy with referee Tony Weeks, ""I'm very upset. I told the referee and the doctor that if Canelo put two or three shots together that I would stop the fight. He landed one punch. Everyone knows Alfredo was coming on strong, everyone knows that.""

lvarez vs. Lara
lvarez fought Erislandy Lara on 12 July 2014, at the MGM Grand in a non-title match. Lara's WBA light middleweight title was not on the line, as the fight took place at a 155-pound catchweight and both fighters weighed in at precisely 155 lbs. lvarez rehydrated to 171 lbs while Lara came into the ring at 166 lbs. In a very close and competitive fight that went to a split decision, lvarez came out on top with two judges scoring 115113 in favor of each fighter and the final judge scoring 117111 in favor of lvarez. The final scorecard was controversial as many observers considered it far too wide. According to CompuBox, Lara landed 55 jabs to nine from lvarez, who landed the jab at a five percent connect rate. lvarez managed to land 88 power punches while Lara landed 53 power punches. Lara's clean punching, defense and movement were weighed against lvarez's effective aggressiveness and power punching. Lara came out in dominant fashion, utilizing a stick-and-move style and capturing the early rounds. Although lvarez struggled with Lara's one-two combinations, Lara's punches weren't thrown with sufficient power or frequency to dissuade him from consistently pressing the fight against a retreating Lara, and he was able to hammer away to Lara's body when he had him on the ropes. Lara's lead hand played a huge role in his one-two combination's effectiveness, but his output dropped as the fight progressed and he became increasingly tentative. lvarez was able to cut Lara with a lead left uppercut in the seventh round. Although the decision remains controversial, any talk of a rematch in the future was dismissed by Oscar De La Hoya who went on to say, ""No one wants a rematch.""

lvarez vs. Kirkland
In January 2015, Oscar De La Hoya announced that lvarez and James Kirkland (321, 28 KOs) had agreed to fight each other although no date or venue was set, in a non-title light middleweight bout. The reason why the date was not set was due to the upcoming Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao fight not having an official date. In March, at the official press conference, the fight was announced to take place at the Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas on 9 May 2015, live on HBO, a week after the 2 May fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao. It marked the first fight of lvarez's lucrative HBO contract. In front of 31,588, lvarez defeated Kirkland via third-round KO. Kirkland came out aggressively, but lvarez wobbled him and scored a knockdown via straight right hand in round one. In the third round, a counter right uppercut sent Kirkland to the canvas. lvarez ended the fight with a jab to the body quickly followed by the right hand, creating the KO. lvarez landed 87 of 150 punches thrown (58%) and Kirkland landed 42 of 197 (21%). After the bout, Kirkland said, ""I did not know I was knocked out."" He was then taken to hospital to undergo a CT scan. The win for lvarez set up a mega PPV fight between himself and WBC middleweight champion Miguel Cotto. The fight drew an average of 2.146 million viewers on HBO and peaked at 2.296 million, the highest viewership for HBO in 2015.

lvarez vs. Cotto

The fight took place at a catchweight of 155 lbs at Cotto's request. Although Cotto gave a tremendous effort, moving nicely throughout the fight, the judges clearly went for lvarez's superior power and accuracy, with surprisingly wide scores of 117111, 119109, and 118110. ESPN.com had the fight much closer, but still scored it in favour of lvarez, 115113. According to CompuBox, lvarez landed 155 of 484 punches (32%) and Cotto landed 129 of 629 (21%), with lvarez landing the heavier blows and inflicting more damage. Two months after the fight, the WBC awarded lvarez the WBC Diamond middleweight title at their headquarters in Mexico.
According to HBO, the fight generated 900,000 buys on PPV, which equated to around $58 million in domestic revenue. This was the first time since 2002, that a PPV generated 900,000 which didn't include Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya. That bout was a heavyweight title fight between Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson.

lvarez vs. Khan
In early 2016, it was announced that British boxer Amir Khan was moving up two weight divisions to fight lvarez at middleweight for his WBC, Ring and lineal middleweight titles. The fight took place on 7 May 2016, at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bout was on HBO PPV. Khan kept his distance in the first five rounds, using his speed to come in and step out which initially caused trouble for lvarez. In round six, lvarez landed a devastating right hand that knocked out Khan. The fight generated a live gate of $7,417,350, according to figures released by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). That total came from 13,072 tickets sold, far short of a sell out. The lvarezKhan gross places it 34th-best in Nevada history. The fight drew close to 600,000 PPV buys.After the fight, lvarez and his team invited middleweight champion Gennady ""GGG"" Golovkin into the ring to promote a future fight between them.

On 18 July, Golden Boy Promotions announced the bout would take place at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, after the MGM Grand in Las Vegas was the other venue looking to host the fight. Having fought his last five fights at his preferred 155-pound catchweight, Canelo said, ""I am very pleased to announce my next fight against Liam Smith, a tremendous fighter with real knockout power, and the WBO light middleweight world title owner, I have no doubt that this fight will be give and take, which will fill the expectations of the fans, and I will work with all the enthusiasm as I always do to get the upper hand on Sept. 17.""In front of a record breaking crowd of 51,240, lvarez regained a world title at light middleweight following a devastating left hook to the body in round nine.

Return to catchweight
lvarez vs. Chvez Jr.
Following Julio Csar Chvez Jr.'s comeback win against Dominik Britsch in December 2016, he claimed he was back and ready to fight Golovkin at 168 lbs and lvarez at a 164-pound catchweight. Negotiations began soon after for a potential HBO PPV fight to take place in 2017 on Cinco de Mayo weekend, as there was interest from both sides that a fight take place. De La Hoya said a fight with Golovkin would still be likely for September 2017. Golden Boy president Eric Gomez confirmed a catchweight of 165 lbs was agreed between both sides. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman was on board, saying he would likely get his organisation involved in the bout and that it was a ""very attractive fight."" On 18 December, Julio Csar Chvez Sr. spoke about the ongoing negotiations, saying Golden Boy were offering his son a small amount for the potential big PPV fight. He went on to claim his son was offered a $5 million purse with no mention he would get a cut of the PPV revenue, a counter offer was submitted. A rematch clause was also discussed, which Chvez Jr. and his team had no problem with. Chvez Sr. went on to admit that he was fully aware lvarez is the A-side in the fight and would settle for no less than 3035% of the full revenue.On 22 December, the WBO made lvarez the mandatory challenger to the middleweight title, skipping the previous number one Avtandil Khurtsidze, which was considered controversial due to lvarez currently not fighting at middleweight. Khurtsidze, who had ten days to appeal decision, decided not to. On 24 December, lvarez and his team gave Chvez Jr. a week to accept the terms, which included a purse of $7 million, or he would consider other options. On 12 January 2017, De La Hoya and lvarez called for the contract to be signed, which was supposedly sent to Al Haymon, who advises Chvez Jr. and urged him to sign it. A day later, Chvez Jr. claimed he had agreed to all the demands set by lvarez and said that he would sign the contract. According to Chvez Jr., the new demands included a weight limit set at 164.5 lbs and a $6 million base purse, plus PPV revenue percentages.On 13 January, lvarez officially confirmed the fight to take place on 6 May 2017.

The figures would increase based on PPV sales.In front of a sold-out crowd of 20,510, lvarez won the fight in dominant fashion via a shutout unanimous decision. All three judges scored it 120108 for lvarez. Chvez Jr. was very cautious throughout the fight. At times, he came forward and also had lvarez against the ropes, but failed to throw any punches. This led to jeers from the crowd in the later rounds due to a lack of action. lvarez spoke to HBO's Max Kellerman in the post-fight interview, talking about his fighting style, ""Tonight, I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things. I thought I was going to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn't do it. I've shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings, I've shown I can showcase myself."" CompuBox stats showed that lvarez landed 228 of 604 his punches thrown (38%) and Chvez Jr. landed 71 of 302 (24%).

Later sources confirmed the fight did close to 1.2 million buys, which means it would have generated around $80 million.

Middleweight
lvarez vs. Golovkin
Immediately after the Chvez Jr. fight, lvarez announced that he would next fight Gennady Golovkin on 16 September 2017, at a location to be determined. Golovkin, who stated he would not attend the fight, was joined by his trainer Abel Sanchez and promoter Tom Loeffler. Golovkin joined him in the ring during the announcement to help promote their upcoming bout. Speaking through a translator, lvarez said, ""Golovkin, you are next, my friend. The fight is done. I've never feared anyone, since I was 15 fighting as a professional. When I was born, fear was gone."" When Golovkin arrived in the ring, he said, ""I feel very excited. Right now is a different story. In September, it will be a different style  a big drama show. I'm ready. Tonight, first congrats to Canelo and his team. Right now, I think everyone is excited for September. Canelo looked very good tonight, and 100 percent he is the biggest challenge of my career. Good luck to Canelo in September.""On 9 May, Eric Gomez, president of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that lvarez had an immediate rematch clause in place on his contract, whereas Golovkin, if he loses, won't be guaranteed a rematch. De La Hoya later revealed in an interview with ESPN that the fight would also take place at the full middleweight limit of 160 lbs with no rehydration clauses, meaning Golovkin and lvarez would be able to gain an unlimited amount of weight following the weigh in. On 5 June, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue of the fight and would mark the first time Golovkin would fight in the state of Nevada. The AT&T Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodgers Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions said in a statement that lvarez would fight for the IBF title, meaning he would participate in the second day weigh in where the IBF requires that each boxer weighs no more than ten lbs over the 160-pound limit. Although he said there was no word on whether lvarez would fight for the WBC title, lvarez claimed that he would not be. On 7 July 2017, Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out.On 15 August, Golden Boy matchmaker Robert Diaz revealed that lvarez would indeed attend the IBF mandatory second day weigh in and fully intended to fight for both the IBF title and the WBA title. He also made it clear that whilst Golovkin would still defend the WBC and IBO title, lvarez would not pay their sanctioning fees. On 22 August, IBF president Daryl Peoples announced that they would be dropping the mandatory second day weigh in for unification fights, meaning neither fighter is required to participate, however they would still encourage them to do so. It was reported that lvarez would earn a base minimum $5 million and Golovkin would earn $3 million, before any shares of the revenue are added to their purses.On fight night, in front of a sold-out crowd of 22,358, Golovkin and lvarez fought to a split draw (118110 lvarez, 115113 Golovkin, and 114114). ESPN's Dan Rafael and HBO's Harold Lederman scored the fight 116112 in favor of Golovkin. Judge Adalaide Byrd's scorecard of 118110 in favor of lvarez was widely ridiculed. Many observers felt that Golovkin had won a narrow, closely contested fight and while a draw was justifiable, a card that wide in favor of lvarez was inexcusable. Nevertheless, Bob Bennett, director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, said that he had full confidence in Byrd going forward. Despite the controversy, several mainstream media outlets referred to the bout as a ""classic"". The fight started with both boxers finding their rhythm, lvarez using his footwork and Golovkin establishing his jab. During the middle rounds, particularly between four and eight, lvarez started each round quickly, but seemed to tire out after a minute, with Golovkin taking over and doing enough to win the rounds. The championship rounds were arguably the best rounds and lvarez started to counter more and both fighters stood toe-to-toe exchanging swings, the majority of which missed. The draw saw Golovkin make his 19th consecutive defense, just one behind middleweight great Bernard Hopkins. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin was the busier of the two, landing 218 of 703 thrown (31%), while lvarez was more accurate, landing 169 of his 505 thrown (34%). Golovkin out landed lvarez in ten of the twelve rounds. The replay, which took place a week later on HBO averaged 726,000, peaking at 840,000 viewers.Speaking to Max Kellerman after the fight, Golovkin said, ""It was a big drama show. [The scoring] is not my fault. I put pressure on him every round. Look, I still have all the belts. I am still the champion."" lvarez felt as though he won the fight, ""In the first rounds, I came out to see what he had. Then I was building from there. I think I won eight rounds. I felt that I won the fight. I think I was superior in the ring. I won at least seven or eight rounds. I was able to counterpunch and made Gennady wobble at least three times. If we fight again, it's up to the people. I feel frustrated over my draw."" Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez believed judge Byrd had her scorecard filled out before the first bell rang. lvarez ruled out another fight in 2017, claiming he would return on Cinco de Mayo weekend in May 2018. At the post-fight press conference, lvarez said through a translator, ""Look, right now I wanna rest. Whatever the fans want, whatever the people want and ask for, we'll do. You know that's my style. But right now, who knows if it's in May or September? But one thing's for sure  this is my era, the era of Canelo"". Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler stated that they would like an immediate rematch, but Golovkin, who prefers fighting at least three times in a calendar year, reiterated his desire to also fight in December.
The fight surpassed Mayweatherlvarez to achieve the third highest gate in boxing history. ESPN reported the fight generated $27,059,850 from 17,318 tickets sold. 934 complimentary tickets were given out, according to the NSAC. Mayweather vs. lvarez sold 16,146 tickets to produce a live gate of $20,003,150.The replay, which took place a week later on HBO averaged 726,000, peaking at 840,000 viewers. The LA Times reported the fight generated 1.3 million domestic PPV buys. Although HBO didn't make an official announcement, it is believed that the revenue would exceed $100 million.

lvarez vs. Golovkin II
Immediately after the controversial ending, talks began for a rematch between lvarez and Golovkin. lvarez stated he would next fight in May 2018, whereas Golovkin was open to fighting in December 2017. ESPN reported that lvarez, who only had the rematch clause in his contract, must activate it within three weeks of their fight. On 19 September, Golden Boy Promotions president Eric Gomez told ESPN that everyone on their side was interested in the rematch and they would hold discussions with Tom Loeffler in the coming days. Ringtv reported that the negotiations would begin on 22 September. On 24 September, Gomez said the rematch would likely take place in the first week of May 2018 or as early as March if a deal could be worked. Despite ongoing negotiations for the rematch, at the 55th annual convention in Baku, Azerbaijan on 2 October, the WBC officially ordered a rematch. Gomez reacted by telling ESPN, ""Regardless of if they did or didn't order the rematch, we are going to try to make it happen. We'll do whatever it takes to make it happen."" On 7 November, Gomez indicated the negotiations were going well and lvarez would make a decision in regards to the rematch in the following weeks. It was believed that Golden Boy would wait until after David Lemieux and Billy Joe Saunders fought for the latter's WBO title on 16 December 2017, before making a decision. On 15 November, Matchroom's Eddie Hearn, promoter of Daniel Jacobs, stated that he approached Tom Loeffler regarding a possible rematch between Golovkin and Jacobs if the lvarezGolovkin rematch failed to take place. On 20 December, Gomez announced that the negotiations were close to being finalized after lvarez gave Golden Boy the go-ahead to write up the contracts. On 29 January 2018, HBO finally announced the rematch would take place in May on Cinco de Mayo weekend. On 22 February, the T-Mobile Arena was again selected as the fight's venue. According to WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman, lvarez would fight Golovkin for their title this time around.In March 2018, lvarez tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol ahead of the fight. Adding to the controversy, Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez claimed that lvarez had his hands wrapped in an illegal manner for the first fight. On 23 March, the NSAC temporarily suspended lvarez due to his two positive tests for the banned substance clenbuterol. lvarez was required to appear at a commission hearing, either in person or via telephone, on the issue on 10 April. The commission would decide at the hearing whether the fight would be permitted to go ahead as scheduled. On 28 March, MGM Resorts International, who own the T-Mobile Arena, started to offer full refunds to anyone who had already purchased tickets for the bout. They wrote, ""In the event a fan requested a refund, they could get one at the original point of sale and in full."" The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported the news. The hearing was rescheduled for 18 April, as Bob Bennett filed a complaint against lvarez. On 3 April, lvarez officially withdrew from the rematch. Golden Boy mentioned during a press conference it was hinted that lvarez would likely not be cleared at the hearing and they would not have enough time to promote the fight.On 13 April, an unofficial source stated that lvarez had checked into a private hospital in Guadalajara for an arthroscopy knee surgery. A spokesperson for Golden Boy later said it was a cosmetic surgery. After surgery, lvarez posted a picture on social media with a caption reading, ""I share that today I had to undergo an arthroscopic surgery to repair the internal femoral cartilage and eliminate a pathological fold of my right knee."" Eric Gomez of Golden Boy later confirmed that lvarez had ""a cyst taken out of his knee"" and there were no serious issues with his knee.At the hearing, lvarez was given a six-month suspension, backdated to his first drug test fail on 17 February, meaning the ban would end on 17 August 2018. The Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) stated that lvarez was not enrolled in their testing program. His promoter De La Hoya then announced that lvarez would return to the ring on Mexican Independence Day weekend.According to Golovkin on 27 April, before he defeated Vanes Martirosyan, a fight with lvarez in the fall was still a priority. During a conference call, he stated it was the ""biggest fight in the world"" and beneficial for all parties involved. Although Golovkin stated the rematch had a ten percent chance of happening, Eric Gomez and Tom Loeffler agreed to meet and start negotiating after 5 May. One of the main issues preventing the rematch to take place was the purse split. lvarez wanted 6535 in his favor, the same terms Golovkin agreed to initially, however Golovkin wanted a straight 5050 split.On 6 June, Golovkin was stripped of his IBF title due to not adhering to the IBF's rules. The IBF granted Golovkin an exception to fight Martirosyan, although they would not sanction the fight and told Golovkin's team to start negotiating and fight mandatory challenger Sergiy Derevyanchenko by 3 August 2018. The IBF released a statement in detail explaining its decision to strip Golovkin of the belt. On 7 June, Golovkin's team stated they would accept a 5545 split in favor of lvarez. Five days later on 12 June, Golden Boy gave Golovkin a 24-hour deadline to accept a 5742 split in lvarez's favor or they would explore other fights. At this time, Golden Boy were already in light negotiations with Eddie Hearn for a fight against Daniel Jacobs instead. At the same time, Loeffler was working closely with Frank Warren to match Saunders with Golovkin at the end of August. Golovkin declined the offer and De La Hoya stated there would be no rematch. Despite this, some sources indicated both sides were still negotiating after a ""Hail Mary"" idea came to light. Hours later, De La Hoya confirmed via his Twitter account that terms had been agreed and the fight would indeed take place on 15 September at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Golovkin revealed to ESPN he agreed to 45%. lvarez started training for the bout on 14 June and stated his intention to apply for his boxing license on 18 August. It was confirmed that both boxers would not physically come face to face with each other until the fight week. A split-screen press conference took place on 3 July. On 3 September, due to a majority vote of the panel, it was announced that the vacant Ring middleweight title would be contested for the bout. Doug Fischer wrote, ""We posed the question to the ratings panel, which, in a landslide, voted in favor the magazine's 160-pound championship being up for grabs when the two stars clash at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.""In front of a sell out crowd of 21,965, the fight was again not without controversy as lvarez defeated Golovkin via majority decision after twelve rounds. lvarez was favored by judges Dave Moretti and Steve Weisfeld, both scoring the bout 115113, the third judge Glenn Feldman scored it 114114. The result was disputed by fans, pundits and media. Of the 18 media outlets scoring the bout, ten ruled in favor of Golovkin, seven scored a draw while one scored the bout for lvarez. The scorecards showed how close the bout was, with the judges splitting eight rounds. After nine rounds, all three judges had their scorecards reading 8784 for lvarez.The fight was much different from the first bout in terms of action. lvarez who was described by Golovkin's team as a ""runner"", altered his style and became more aggressive. Both boxers found use of their respective jabs from the opening round with Golovkin using his jab more as the fight went on. Big punches were landed by both fighters during the bout, with both lvarez and Golovkin showing excellent chins. Despite the tense build up, both boxers showed each other respect after the fight. lvarez made good use of his body attack, landing 46 compared to Golovkin's six landed. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin landed 234 of 879 punches thrown (27%) and lvarez landed 202 of his 622 punches (33%). Golovkin had the edge in jabs, landing 118 out of 547 (21.6%) compared to 59 out of 256 (23%) for lvarez. However, lvarez had the edge in power punches, landing 143 out of 366 (39.1%) compared to 116 out of 332 (34.9%) for Golovkin. In eight of the rounds Golovkin outlanded lvarez in total punches whereas lvarez outlanded him in power punches in 9 of the rounds.lvarez stated that the fight was a ""clear victory"" and that ""in the end, it was a victory for Mexico. And again, it was an opportunity. And I want to shout out to my opponent, the best in the sport of boxing. I am a great fighter, and I showed it tonight. If the people want another round, I'll do it again. But for right now, I will enjoy time with my family."" Golovkin did not take part in the post-fight and made his way backstage where he received stitches for a cut over his right eye. He later responded to the defeat, explaining that ""I'm not going to say who won tonight, because the victory belongs to Canelo, according to the judges. I thought it was a very good fight for the fans and very exciting. I thought I fought better than he did."" Both fighters were open to a trilogy.The fight generated a live gate of $23,473,500 from 16,732 tickets sold. This was lower than the first bout, but still the fourth largest-grossing gates in Nevada boxing history.

Among them, only Hearns, Leonard, and Alvarez himself established their careers at welterweight and claimed the title at the 175 pound limit.After the fight, Kovalev suggested that he had always been unlikely to win the fight, due to the grueling schedule of back-to-back training camps which resulted from the short period of time between fighting Anthony Yarde on 24 August and lvarez on 2 November, but he had agreed to fight the latter regardless due to the high financial incentive, reported to be $12 million. lvarez himself was reported to have received a purse of $35 million for the fight. lvarez responded by calling Kovalev a ""bad loser"".For his 2019 campaign, lvarez was named the fighter of the year by The Ring Magazine, ESPN, Sports Illustrated, and the Boxing Writers Association of America.

lvarez vs. Yldrm
It was announced on 20 January 2021 that lvarez would be defending his titles against WBC mandatory challenger Avni Yldrm on 27 February at the Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida. The bout attracted criticism due to many perceiving Yldrm, who had not been in the ring since he lost a technical split decision to Anthony Dirrell two years prior in February 2019, to be vastly over-matched. Yldrm had been named to the mandatory position as a result of the controversial nature of his loss to Dirrell, however, he had remained sidelined due to injury and the COVID-19 pandemic. lvarez, who was mandated to face Yldrm in order to retain the WBC title despite being heavily favored, was dismissive of the critics, saying ""I really don't have to give any explanation because they're never gonna be happy with anything... He [Yldrm] has lots of courage. He can be dangerous at any moment because he is a strong fighter.""In a one-sided fight, lvarez defeated Yldrm by third-round corner retirement after Yldrm's corner threw in the towel at the end of the third round.

After lvarez's successful defense against Avni Yldrm, promoter Eddie Hearn confirmed lvarez would be facing WBO titleholder and undefeated two-weight world champion Billy Joe Saunders in a unification bout on May 8 at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Prior to the fight, there was a dispute between the two fighters' camps regarding the size of the ring: Saunders was unhappy with the proposed 18-foot ring. He instead wanted a 24-foot ring and threatened to pull out of the fight if his request wasn't met, despite having boxed primarily in 20-foot rings in his bouts in the past in the United Kingdom. He ultimately settled for a 22-foot ring after lvarez said, ""I don't care about the size of the ring, I'm just gonna go in there and do my job. It's not the only excuse he's had. He's had plenty of excuses,"" referencing when Saunders had previously voiced his concerns about the selection of judges for the fight.In front of a record breaking crowd of 73,126 for boxing attendance at an indoor facility in the United States, lvarez won via eighth-round corner retirement when Saunders' team threw in the towel due to Saunders having suffered a fractured orbital bone as a result of an uppercut landed by lvarez. At the time of the stoppage, lvarez was winning on the scorecards 7874 (twice) and 7775. Throughout the fight, lvarez outlanded Saunders 73 to 60 in total punches and landed 53% of his power punches.In the immediate post-fight press conference, lvarez was confronted by undefeated WBO middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade who asked him when they were going to fight, before accusing lvarez of ducking him. lvarez responded to him in English dismissively, calling him a ""horrible fighter"", and criticizing his resume: ""Man, you fight with nobody. You are a champion but you fight with nobody."" Before Andrade was removed from the press conference, lvarez told him, ""Get the fuck outta here. Please, get the fuck outta here. Get the fuck outta here because I'm gonna fuck you up right now motherfucker.""

lvarez vs. Plant
After months of negotiations, lvarez announced on his social media on 19 August 2021 that he would be facing undefeated IBF champion Caleb Plant on 6 November at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, in an undisputed showdown for all four major world titles in the super middleweight division, with the winner set to become the first ever undisputed champion at that weight class. On 21 September 2021, the two fighters were engaged in a brief onstage scuffle during their first press conference, in which lvarez initiated physical contact during their face-off when he shoved Plant. lvarez stated that he had done this because he took offense to Plant's use of the word ""motherfucker"", interpreting it as an insult to his mother. Plant denied to reporters that he had used the common American curse word in that context. Moreover, he drew attention to lvarez's hypocrisy, accurately indicating that lvarez had previously used the same slur against Demetrius Andrade on the night of 8 May 2021 in the aftermath of his fight against Billy Joe Saunders in Arlington, Texas.On fight night, lvarez won the bout via eleventh-round technical knockout. He had knocked his opponent to the canvas with a left hook right uppercut combination in the penultimate round, before closing in to drop Plant again, prompting referee Russell Mora to call off the bout. At the time of the stoppage, lvarez was ahead on the scorecards with 9892, 9694, and 9793. With this win, he became only the sixth fighter to unify all belts in one division in the four-belt era.

Return to light heavyweight
lvarez vs. Bivol
At the WBC Convention on 15 November 2021 in Mexico City, the WBC approved the request of lvarez's trainer and manager, Eddy Reynoso, to have lvarez challenge Ilunga Makabu for his WBC cruiserweight title. lvarez has never competed at cruiserweight, so Reynoso had needed to petition the WBC to order the title fight. The cruiserweight limit was 200 pounds, but it had recently been reduced to 190 pounds by the WBC due to the introduction of bridgerweight. The fight had been rumored to take place in May 2022. This ultimately did not materialize, as Makabu was forced into a mandatory defense of his title in a rematch against Thabiso Mchunu on 29 January 2022, which the former won via split decision. Instead, it was announced on 25 February 2022 that lvarez had signed a two-fight deal with Matchroom Boxing; the first fight would see him returning to the light heavyweight division to challenge undefeated WBA (Super) champion Dmitry Bivol on 7 May in a bout that would be televised as sports streaming service DAZN's first pay-per-view offering in the United States and Canada.In a surprise upset, all three judges scored the bout 115113 in Bivol's favor to hand lvarez the second defeat of his professional career. According to CompuBox punch statistics, Bivol had outlanded lvarez in every single round of the fight, for a total of 152 punches landed out of 710 thrown (21%), compared to lvarez's 84 of 495 (17%). Many media reporters and pundits drew attention to the judges' official scorecards: all three judges had scored lvarez the winner of the first four rounds, something that was roundly criticized, and described by ESPN reporter Mike Coppinger as ""puzzling"". Despite the widespread public opinion that Bivol was the deserved winner, lvarez disagreed with this notion, stating in his post-fight interview: ""I don't feel like I lost the fight... Personally, I felt he [Bivol] only won four or five rounds."" He went on to express his desire to fight Bivol again: ""We want the rematch, and we're going to do better in the rematch."" Despite this, a rematch between lvarez and Bivol did not materialize immediately, as the former opted to face WBA (Super) and IBF middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin in a trilogy bout as his opponent for his next fight instead.

lvarez vs. Golovkin III

He's an asshole person... He's talking a lot of things about me. That's why it's personal."" lvarez went on to express his excitement at the prospect of sending his opponent into retirement, and admitted that he received gratification from making Golovkin wait four years for a trilogy bout on his own terms, in his preferred weight class of super middleweight: ""It makes me feel good.""On fight night, lvarez defeated Golovkin via unanimous decision with the scores of 115113 (twice) and 116112.

,,,tyson fury,33,24,1,0,0,0.04,"Tyson Luke Fury (born 12 August 1988) is a British professional boxer. He has held the World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight title since 2020. Previously, he held the unified heavyweight titles from 2015 to 2016, and the Ring magazine title twice between 2015 and 2022. He also held the International Boxing Organization (IBO) title during his first reign as champion.
With his defeat of Deontay Wilder, Fury became the third heavyweight, after Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali, to hold The Ring magazine title twice, and is widely considered by media outlets to be the lineal heavyweight champion. As of December 2022, Fury is ranked as the world's best active heavyweight by BoxRec and ESPN, he is also ranked sixth pound-for-pound by ESPN and the Boxing Writers Association of America, and seventh by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board.As an amateur, Fury represented both England and Ireland, as he was born in Manchester to an Irish Traveller family. Fury's family lineage comes from Belfast and Galway; his parents emigrated to England at a young age. He won the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008 before turning professional later that year at 20 years of age. After winning the English heavyweight title twice, he became the British and Commonwealth champion in 2011 by defeating the 140 Derek Chisora. He then won the Irish and WBO Inter-Continental titles, before defeating Chisora again in a 2014 rematch for the European and WBO International heavyweight titles. This success, along with his 240 record, set up a match with the long-reigning world champion Wladimir Klitschko in Germany, which Fury won by unanimous decision.
Fury was stripped of his IBF title 10 days after the Klitschko bout as he was unable to grant a fight with the IBF's mandatory challenger, Vyacheslav Glazkov, due to a rematch clause in his contract with Klitschko. The rematch did not materialise as Fury had mental health issues leading to alcoholism, recreational drug use and extreme weight gain. In 2016, he vacated the WBA, WBO and IBO titles; The Ring stripped him of his last remaining title in early 2018. Later that year, after more than two years of inactivity, Fury challenged for the WBC heavyweight title against Wilder. The fight was controversially scored as a draw. Fury's strong performance against Wilder (including recovering from a heavy knockdown in the final round) earned him Comeback of the Year from The Ring and numerous other awards. In the rematch in February 2020, Fury defeated Wilder by a technical knockout in the seventh round after a dominant performance. He knocked out Wilder again in the trilogy fight in October 2021, this time in the eleventh round.

Early life
Tyson Luke Fury was born in the Wythenshawe area of Manchester on 12 August 1988, the son of Irish Traveller parents Amber and John Fury. He was born three months premature and weighed just 1 pound (450 g). His father named him after American boxer Mike Tyson, who was the heavyweight world champion at the time, and later explained, ""The doctors told me there was not much chance of him living. I had lost two daughters in the same way who had been born prematurely."" He decided on the name ""Tyson"" as Fury was ""a fighter"" and survived the premature birth.Fury grew up in Styal, Cheshire, and would later often mention his love for both Styal and his birthplace of Manchester. His paternal grandfather was from Tuam, which is also the birthplace of his father. The Furys are ultimately of Gaelic origin, deriving their present surname from  Fiodhabhra. His maternal grandmother is from County Tipperary and his mother was born in Belfast. Despite strongly identifying with his Irish heritage, Fury has had problems in gaining dual citizenship because his father's birth in County Galway was not recorded civilly in the 1960s, as Irish Travellers at the time only recorded births through baptism with the church rather than officially with the state. After dethroning Wladimir Klitschko, Fury would quip that ""becoming the heavyweight champion of the world is not as hard a fight as proving [his] Irishness"".Fury left school when he was 11, and joined his father and three brothers tarmacking roads. His mother Amber had 14 pregnancies in total, but only four of the children survived. A daughter, Ramona, was born in December 1997 but died within days. This experience has stayed with Fury, who was just nine years old at the time. Fury began boxing at the age of 10. His father, John, trained him until 2011, when he was jailed for gouging out the eye of another Traveller due to a long-standing feud. Fury's uncle Hughie Fury trained him until he died in 2014, after which Fury's other uncle Peter Fury (trainer of son Hughie Fury) trained him in preparation for his fight against Wladimir Klitschko. Peter Fury is also a former boxer, and was previously jailed for 10 years in 1995; he established an amphetamine trafficking network in North West England, and continued to oversee the criminal enterprise while behind bars. Fury himself has not had trouble with the law.The Fury family has a long history in boxing. Fury's father competed in the 1980s as ""Gypsy"" John Fury, initially as a bare-knuckle and unlicensed boxer, and then as a professional boxer. John had a professional record of 841, with one of his losses being to future WBO heavyweight world champion Henry Akinwande. Tyson's half-brother Tommy made his professional debut on 22 December 2018 under the tutelage of two-weight world champion Ricky Hatton. Fury is also a cousin of several professional boxers, including heavyweights Hughie Fury and Nathan Gorman, retired WBO middleweight world champion Andy Lee and light heavyweight contender Hosea Burton. Fury's distant relatives include the bare-knuckle boxers Uriah Burton and Bartley Gorman, both considered ""King of the Gypsies"", hence Fury's own nickname of ""Gypsy King"". He has also styled himself as ""The Furious One"" and ""2 Fast"" Fury.

Amateur career
As an amateur, Fury represented both England and Ireland. Fury represented Ireland three times at international level. He was based out of the Holy Family Boxing Club in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and later switched to the Smithboro Club in County Monaghan, Ireland. In a double international match against an experienced Polish team in 2007, the Irish team lost 126 overall; Fury, however, was victorious in both his fights in Rzeszw and Biaystok. In another Irish match against the US, Fury won his bout by knockout. He won bronze at the AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships in 2006.In England, while representing Jimmy Egan's Boxing Academy in Wythenshawe, Manchester, he participated in the senior national championships in 2006 but was beaten by David Price 228. In May 2007, he won the EU Junior Championship, defeating Istvan Bernath in the final. In July 2007 he won silver at the European Junior Championship, losing to Maxim Babanin in the final.As a junior, Fury was ranked number three in the world behind the Russians Maxim Babanin and Andrey Volkov, but did not get the chance to represent Great Britain at the 2008 Olympics because each country is restricted to one boxer per weight division and David Price was selected. Price came up through the amateur Olympic programme. Fury also unsuccessfully tried to qualify for Ireland. Speaking in 2011, Fury said ""I should have gone to the Olympic games in 2008 and won a gold medal for Ireland, but I was denied the chance to go and do it""  He was also forced to withdraw from the Irish national championships after officials from the Holy Trinity Boxing Club in West Belfast, the club of the then Irish amateur heavyweight champion, submitted a protest regarding his eligibility as he was not born in Ireland.Fury won the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008 by defeating Damien Campbell 19:1. He turned professional later that year. Feeling disillusioned with amateur boxing, he decided not to wait for the 2012 Olympics. He finished with an amateur record of 314 (26 KOs).

Professional career
Early career
Fury made his professional debut at the age of 20 on 6 December 2008 in Nottingham, on the undercard of Carl Froch vs. Jean Pascal against Hungarian fighter Bela Gyongyosi (392), who Fury defeated via TKO in the first round with a combination to head and body. He then had six more fights in the space of seven months, defeating Marcel Zeller (213), Daniil Peretyatko (1520), Lee Swaby (23222), Matthew Ellis (2061), Scott Belshaw (101) and Aleksandrs Selezens (36) all via knockout within 4 rounds.On 11 September 2009, Fury fought John McDermott (255, 16 KOs) for the English heavyweight title, and won via a points decision. Fury came in as a 16 favourite but produced a poor display, and the 9892 decision by the referee Terry O'Connor was criticised as a ""travesty"". The decision led the British Boxing Board of Control to mandate three judges for all English titles, and the board ordered a rematch.Fury scored two more victories against Tomas Mrazek (4225) and Hans-Joerg Blasko (93) before facing McDermott in a rematch on 25 June 2010. Fury settled the controversy of the first fight, as he knocked down McDermott three times, first in the 8th round then twice in the 9th round to win by TKO. Fury won the English heavyweight title for a second time in the process. Another three wins followed: points decisions over American fighters Rich Power (120) and Zack Page (21322) in two 8-round matches, and a knockout of the Brazilian Marcelo Luiz Nascimento (130) in the 5th round.

British and Commonwealth champion
Fury vs. Chisora

Although Pajkic hobbled Fury again at the outset of round 3, Fury came back to knock down Pajkic twice during that round. The referee stopped the fight after the last knockdown, causing Pajkic to protest, who declared himself ready to fight on. Many at ringside thought the stoppage premature. The fight averaged 1.72 million viewers on Channel 5.Fury vacated his British and Commonwealth belts in order to pursue a future world title match. He said to the media of his decision to vacate the belts, ""I vacated the British and Commonwealth titles, which some people say are more prestigious than the Irish title, but not to me. I vacated those belts for an Irish title shot because it meant more to me. All my people are from Ireland. I was born in Manchester but I am Irish."" On 14 April 2012, Fury travelled to Belfast to fight at the Odyssey Arena for the vacant Irish heavyweight title. His opponent was veteran Martin Rogan (142, 7 KOs). Rogan had not fought in 18 months and had not beaten an opponent with a winning record since 2009.  At 245+34 pounds (111.5 kg), Fury was fighting at the lightest weight of his professional career to date. Fury put Rogan on the canvas with a left hook in the third round.

The fight averaged 1.33 million viewers on Channel 5.On 7 July, Fury fought for the vacant WBO Inter-Continental heavyweight title against American boxer Vinny Maddalone (357, 26 KOs) at the Hand Arena in Clevedon, Somerset. Fury weighed 245.5 pounds (111.4 kg), marginally lighter than the Rogan fight. Maddalone entered with a record of 43 in his previous seven bouts. Fury improved his record to 190 with 14 stoppage wins, with a fifth-round technical knockout over Maddalone. Fury controlled the fight from the onset and stunned Maddalone with a combination in the opening round. Fury continued to land heavy punches and opened a cut under his opponent's left eye in the fourth. In round 5, with Maddalone taking punches, the referee stepped in and called an end to the bout with blood streaming out of the cut under the veteran's left eye. It was the fifth knockout loss of Maddalone's professional career. In the post-fight interviews, Fury said, ""I knew it was a matter of time. I actually called the referee over, he was taking some big shots. I'm still undefeated. I would like to say I'm ready for anyone in the world. Klitschkos, bring them on. Americans, bring them on. Bring on Tomasz Adamek. He's too small for me and I see an early win for me."" Promoter Mick Hennessy also stated a world title fight was ""two or three fights away"", targeting Adamek next. The fight averaged 1.05 million viewers on Channel 5.

Earlier, in round five, Fury was docked a point following a headbutt. At the time of the stoppage, Fury was behind on two judges' scorecards 5755, while the other judge had it 5656 (even). A week after the fight, Cunningham spoke to ATG Radio, claiming that Fury used an illegal manoeuvre to knock him out, ""He held me with his forearm.

Cancelled David Haye fight
Fury was due to fight David Haye (262, 24 KOs) on 28 September 2013, in a fight which would have seen Fury fight on a pay-per-view platform for the first time. However, Haye pulled out of the fight on 21 September, after sustaining a cut, which required six stitches, above the eye during training. The fight was originally postponed to 8 February 2014. Haye pulled out of the fight a second time on 17 November, stating that he had a career-threatening shoulder injury which required surgery, and hinted at his retirement. Fury believed that Haye was making excuses because he did not want the fight, saying ""I'm absolutely furious but in all honesty this is exactly what I expected. Everyone knows I was very suspicious when he pulled out the first time and this confirms to me that he's always been afraid of me and never wanted this fight."" Aside from training camp expenses, Haye also cost Fury his positions in the world rankings including an IBF final eliminator bout which would have made him mandatory for a shot at the world title.

Fury vs. Abell
On 24 January 2014, it was announced that Fury would fight at the Copper Box Arena against Argentine veteran Gonzalo Omar Basile (618, 27 KOs) on 15 February. On 5 February, Basile pulled out of the fight due to a lung infection. He was replaced by American journeyman Joey Abell (297, 28 KOs). Fury won the fight via 4th-round TKO, which set up a rematch with Chisora in the summer. Ring rust showed in the opening two rounds with Abell connecting with left hands, which had Fury against the ropes. But Fury managed to compose himself and get behind the jab. In the third round, Fury floored Abell with a right hand. Abell beat the count but was floored again, this time being saved by the bell. Two more knockdowns followed in round 4 ending the fight. After the fight, Fury took to the microphone, ""Tyson too fast Fury, that's the name, fighting's the game and these are bums compared to me. I want Wladimir Klitschko, he's avoiding me, let's get it on Wlad.""

European heavyweight champion
Fury vs. Chisora II
Fury was due to fight rival and heavyweight contender Derek Chisora for the second time on 26 July 2014, for the European and once again the British heavyweight title. On 21 July, Chisora was forced to pull out after sustaining a fractured hand in training. Russian Alexander Ustinov was lined up as Chisora's replacement in the bout scheduled to take place at the Manchester Arena, Fury pulled out of the fight after his uncle and former trainer Hughie Fury was taken seriously ill. However, Fury and Chisora rescheduled the rematch for 29 November 2014 at ExCeL London. The bout was also a WBO title eliminator and shown live on BoxNation. Fury was victorious again after dominating the fight up until Chisora's corner pulled him out at the end of the 10th round. Fury also used a southpaw stance for the majority of the fight, despite the traditional right-handed orthodox stance being his preference. Fury used his jab to trouble Chisora and stayed on the outside with his longer reach to dominate the fight. Chisora failed to land any telling punches, and due to Fury's awkward fighting style, ended up hitting him below the belt. Chisora was warned by referee Marcus McDonnell in the first round. After the fight, Fury said, ""Wladimir Klitschko, I'm coming for you, baby. I'm coming. No retreat, no surrender."" Promoter Mick Hennessy said Fury would likely fight once more before challenging for the world title.

Fury went on to win the fight when it came to a halt in the 8th round via corner stoppage. Fury dominated the fight from the opening bell and dropped Hammer in round 5 with a short right hook. After the fight, Fury called out Wladimir Klitschko again, stating he was ready for his world title shot.

For this match, Fury trained with the highest ranked heavyweight kickboxers in GLORY, Rico Verhoeven and Benjamin Adegbuyi.The fight took place at Esprit Arena in Dsseldorf, Germany. On fight night, there was controversy with the gloves, then a complaint about the ring canvas. Klitschko reportedly had his hands wrapped without the presence of a Fury representative, so had to do them again. Fury won after 12 rounds by a unanimous decision. The judges scored the fight 115112, 115112, and 116111. Klitschko and Fury showed little offence during the 12 rounds, but Fury was more active and did enough each round to take the decision. Klitschko landed 52 of 231 punches thrown (23%) and Fury landed 86 of 371 thrown (23%).In the post-fight interview, an emotional Fury said, ""This is a dream come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries and get decisions. It just means so much to me to come here and get the decision."" He then took the microphone and thanked Klitschko, ""I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup."" Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, ""Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had."" Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.On 8 December 2015, the IBF stripped Fury of its title, as the contract for the fight against Klitschko included a rematch clause, precluding Fury from facing the IBF's mandatory challenger Vyacheslav Glazkov. Fury had held the IBF belt for only 10 days.

Relinquishing world titles
Following months of negotiation, the rematch with Klitschko was announced on 8 April 2016, this time with the fight scheduled to take place in Fury's hometown of Manchester at the Manchester Arena on 9 July 2016. Despite agreeing terms for the rematch, Fury said he had ""no motivation"" and had gained an extreme amount of weight after the first fight, as he weighed over 330 pounds (150 kg) by April 2016. On 24 June 2016, it was announced that this fight would be postponed to a later date due to Fury sustaining a sprained ankle in training. On the same day, Fury and his cousin, Hughie Fury, were charged by UK Anti-Doping ""with presence of a prohibited substance"", namely nandrolone, from a sample taken 16 months previously in February 2015. Tyson and Hughie said that they ""strenuously deny"" the charge. On 23 September, Fury again postponed the fight after being declared ""medically unfit"". ESPN reported that Fury had failed a drug test for cocaine a day before the second postponement. Fury cited problems with depression after the positive test for cocaine.Fury's mental health deteriorated after winning the world titles. On 4 October 2016, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Fury said ""I'm going through a lot of personal demons, trying to shake them off, this has got nothing to do with my fighting  what I'm going through right now is my personal life. I've not been in a gym for months. I've been going through depression. I just don't want to live anymore, if you know what I'm saying. I've had total enough of it. Never mind cocaine. I just didn't care. I don't want to live anymore. So cocaine is a little minor thing compared to not wanting to live anymore. I am seeing help, but they can't do nothing for me. What I've got is incurable. I don't want to live. All the money in the world, fame and glory, means nothing if you're not happy. I'm seeing psychiatrists. They say I've got a version of bipolar. I'm a manic depressive. I don't even want to wake up. I hope I die every day. And that's a bad thing to say when I've got three children and a lovely wife isn't it? But I don't want to live anymore. And if I could take me own life  and I wasn't a Christian  I'd take it in a second. I just hope someone kills me before I kill me self. I'll have to spend eternity in hell. I've been out drinking, Monday to Friday to Sunday, and taking cocaine. I can't deal with it and the only thing that helps me is when I get drunk out of me mind.""On 12 October 2016, pending investigation on an anti-doping case about his cocaine use, nandrolone findings, and being deemed medically unfit to fight, Fury decided to vacate the WBA (Unified), WBO, IBO heavyweight titles. He said ""I won the titles in the ring and I believe that they should be lost in the ring, but I'm unable to defend at this time and I have taken the hard and emotional decision to now officially vacate my treasured world titles and wish the next in-line contenders all the very best as I now enter another big challenge in my life which I know, like against Klitschko, I will conquer."" Fury's promoter Mick Hennessy added: ""Tyson will still be the lineal world heavyweight champion in everyone's eyes. He beat the most dominant champion in the modern era of boxing on an amazing night in Germany to earn that accolade and that will never change. Whilst it's heartbreaking to see Tyson vacate the world titles that he worked so long and hard for all his life, what's paramount now is that he receives the medical treatment along with the love of his family and friends and the support of the boxing world to make a full recovery."" Fury's decision was based on not having to put himself under constant media pressure, allowing him time to recover and receive professional medical help for his mental health problems, and spend time with his family. On 13 October, the British Boxing Board of Control decided to suspend Fury's boxing licence. On 1 February 2018, Fury was stripped of his last remaining title, The Ring magazine's heavyweight championship.

Issues with UKAD and BBBofC
In December 2016, Fury's uncle Peter announced that Fury would be returning around spring in 2017 and would aim for a fight against WBC champion Deontay Wilder. On 23 December, Fury tweeted that he was back in training ahead of a ring return around April or May 2017. His tweet read, ""I've had a nightmare 2016, done a lot of stuff I'm not proud of, but my promise to you is I'll return in 2017."" On 6 March 2017, Fury tweeted that his return fight would take place on 13 May 2017 and he was speaking to promoter Frank Warren about possible opponents. Warren had become Fury's promoter after Fury dropped his long-time promoter Mick Hennessy. The date set for the return would mean Fury would be fighting on the undercard of Josh Warrington defending his WBC International featherweight title against Kiko Martinez at the First Direct Arena in Leeds. Hours after Fury announced a comeback date, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) publicly announced that Fury was still suspended and would not be fighting in May. This was confirmed by their general secretary Robert Smith. He also mentioned that there had been no contact from Fury or his representatives since the ban started in October 2016. Warren told Reuters on 7 March, ""I want to see him back in the ring as soon as possible but before that happens he's got a couple of issues to sort out."" Warren said that along with the dispute with the BBBofC there would need to be a court hearing with UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).Robert Smith, general secretary of the BBBofC, said in May 2017 that Fury's case was ""complex"" and it had been adjourned. In September 2017, Fury challenged UKAD to give him a reply, and either ban him or reinstate his boxing licence. He believed he was being treated unfairly as it had taken over a year for them to reply, stating that usually the problem would be dealt with within a matter of months. Fury tweeted, ""How long must I be held up and kept out of action? It's been 15 months since I've been under investigation, you're keeping an innocent man from fulfilling his destiny and from providing for his family."" UKAD stated there was no particular timescale involved, but denied claims that they were prolonging the hearing. Instead they said they were trying to resolve the matter as soon as possible.On 8 November 2017, BBC Sport reported that a National Anti-Doping Panel hearing was due to take place in December. Due to the legal battle between Fury and UKAD, it was believed that UKAD could potentially become insolvent or would need a government bail out. UKAD reportedly have an annual budget of 8 million, and the fact that Fury had not fought for two years would have caused potential loss of earnings, possibly over 10 million. UKAD asked the government if they could underwrite the case. On 23 November, according to Robert Smith of the BBBofC, a hearing was set for a date in December 2017. On 25 November 2017, Fury announced his comeback after signing with managerial group MTK Global. A hearing start date of 11 December was set, with a potential outcome being Fury facing a four-year ban. Fury did not attend the hearing and had reporters waiting outside the location for six hours before leaving. Mick Hennessy later stated that Fury was not required at the hearing. On 7 February 2018, UKAD revealed they spent 585,659 on the Fury case. 576,587 was paid to London law firm Bird & Bird, barrister fees came to 1,130 and around 8,000 was paid for laboratory work. UKAD believed they could regain 250,000 through legal insurance.On 12 December, UKAD announced they had agreed with the Furys and the BBBoC to resolve the charges. ""Taking into account the delays in results management that meant charges were not brought in respect of the nandrolone findings until June 2016, and the provisional suspensions that Tyson and Hughie Fury have already effectively served, the two year period of ineligibility is backdated to 13 December 2015, and therefore expires at midnight on 12 December 2017."" Tyson's February 2015 win over Christian Hammer was disqualified but his Klitschko triumph was not. Tyson blamed the elevated nandrolone levels on eating uncastrated wild boar and declared his and Hughie's innocence, ""Hughie and I have maintained our innocence from day one and we're now happy that it has finally been settled with UKAD and that we can move forward knowing that we'll not be labelled drug cheats."" The BBBofC said they would consider the renewal of Fury's boxing licence in January 2018. In relation to the news, Fury wrote on Twitter, ""Guess who's back?""

Comeback trail
On 10 January 2018, Fury announced he would be re-applying for his boxing licence through the BBBofC. An interview took place between Fury and BBBofC on 19 January, where the latter agreed to re-instate Fury as long as he sent them up-to-date medical records after visiting a psychologist.  Fury said a motivation on his return was Deontay Wilder. ""He said I couldn't do it, he said definitely not Tyson Fury. He's done."" At a press conference in London on 12 April 2018, Fury announced he had signed a multi-fight deal with Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions. He stated that he intended to fight at least three times before 2019, starting on 9 June at the Manchester Arena. After weeks of speculation, it was confirmed the fight would be shown exclusively on BT Sport.

Fury vs. Seferi
On 20 May 39-year-old Albanian Sefer Seferi (231, 21 KOs) was announced as Fury's opponent in a 10-round bout. Seferi was a career cruiserweight, having fought once at heavyweight, when he lost to Manuel Charr in 2016. Fury weighed 276 pounds (125 kg) at the weigh-in, 66 pounds (30 kg) heavier than Seferi. Fury had lost 112 pounds (51 kg) for the fight, having experienced extreme weight gain due to his mental health problems. Fury won the fight after Seferi quit on his stool after round 4. The opening couple of rounds had little to no action as Fury was showboating, which referee Phil Edwards warned him for in round 2. A brawl also broke out in the crowd during the fight, but order was restored before the fight came to an end. Fury began to unload heavy shots in round 4 and it appeared many of the shots landed and hurt Seferi, hence he retired on his stool. After the fight, Warren confirmed Fury would next return on the Carl Frampton undercard on 18 August at Windsor Park in Belfast. It was revealed the fight, which aired exclusively on BT Sport 1, peaked at 814,000 live viewers.

Fury vs. Pianeta
On 12 July 2018, it was announced that Fury would fight former two-time world title challenger Francesco Pianeta (3541, 21 KOs) on 18 August. Fury weighed in at 258 pounds (117 kg), 18 pounds (8.2 kg) lighter than he weighed against Seferi. Pianeta came in at 254.7 pounds (115.5 kg). On 30 July, it was reported that there was ongoing negotiations for a fight to take place in either November or December 2018 between Fury and Wilder (400, 39 KOs). On 31 July, Fury stated the fight against Wilder was 99% a done deal, with only a location and date to be confirmed. Fury also had to come through in his bout against Pianeta. Wilder was scheduled to be in Belfast to further promote the fight. Fury went the full 10 rounds, defeating Pianeta via a points decision. Referee Steve Gray scored the fight 10090 in favour of Fury. Fury later revealed he had no intention of trying to end the fight early. He said, ""I think it was a calculated boxing performance. I got 10 rounds with a very tough man under my belt. I was working on my jab, slipping his punches. I thought that was a step up with the opponent and display. I needed the rounds, and I had plenty left in the tank."" According to CompuBox, Fury landed 107 of 620 punches thrown (17%). This included 100 power punches landed of 226 thrown (44%). Pianeta landed only 37 of his 228 punches thrown (16%).During the post-fight interviews, promoter Warren confirmed the Fury vs. Wilder fight was on. The fight would take place in either Las Vegas or New York in November 2018. The fight would be aired on PPV in the United States on Showtime and in the UK on BT Sports Box Office. Talking about how the fight came together, Fury said, ""We have two men who will fight anyone. This man has been trying to make a fight with another chump. They called, I answered. I said: 'Send me the contract.' They sent it. I said 'yes'."" Warren later told BBC Radio 5 live, ""[It's a] 5050 [purse split], quick and smooth negotiations. He was the world heavyweight champion. He's undefeated. [Wilder and his team] understand that. All of the terms are agreed."" By the end of August, contracts for the fight to take place had been signed.

WBC heavyweight title challenge
Fury vs. Wilder
On 22 September, both Fury and Wilder confirmed they had signed the contract and the fight would take place on 1 December 2018. According to the California State Athletic Commission, Wilder would earn a guaranteed base purse of $4 million and Fury would take home a guaranteed purse of $3 million. Despite Frank Warren's original claim that the revenue would be split 5050, it was revealed that Wilder could make $14 million (11 million) and Fury would earn around $10.25 million (8 million). Both boxers would see this increase to their base purses after receiving their percentages from pay-per-view revenue. The weigh-in took place on 30 November, outside the Los Angeles Convention Center. Fury stepped on the scale first and weighed in at 256+12 pounds (116.3 kg). This was only 2 pounds (0.91 kg) lighter than his weigh-in against Francisco Pianeta in August 2018, but he looked leaner. Wilder was next to step on and came in at 212+12 pounds (96.4 kg), his lowest since his debut in 2008 when he weighed 207+14 pounds (94.0 kg). For his last bout, Wilder weighed 214 pounds (97 kg), however, it was cited that Wilder became ill during his training camp.In front of a crowd of 17,698 at the Staples Center, Wilder and Fury fought a 12-round split decision draw, meaning Wilder retained his WBC title. Mexican judge Alejandro Rochin scored the fight 115111 for Wilder, Canadian judge Robert Tapper had it 114112 for Fury and English judge Phil Edwards scored it a 113113 draw. The crowd booed at the decision with many believing Fury did enough to dethrone Wilder. Fury, using his unorthodox stance, spent much of the fight using upper and lower-body movement to avoid Wilder big shots and stay out of range. There was not much action in round 1 as both boxers used the round to feel each other out. Wilder tried to trap Fury into the corner, but Fury made Wilder miss most of his big swings. In round 4, Wilder bloodied Fury's nose with his stiff jabs, but was unable to follow up on the attacks. In round 6, Fury switched to southpaw stance and had success backing Wilder against the ropes and at the same time stayed cautious of Wilder's power. In round 7, after trading jabs, which saw Fury come out on top, Fury landed a counter right hand, then quickly tied Wilder up before he could throw anything back. Round 8 saw back and forth action with both trying to land. Wilder threw a lot of power shots which Fury mostly evaded. In round 9, Wilder finally dropped Fury with a short left hook followed by an overhand right. Fury beat referee Jack Reiss' count and survived the round. Having expended a lot of energy trying to finish Fury in round 9, Wilder looked fatigued in round 10. This came to as an advantage for Fury as he landed two right hands. Fury also took advantage in round 11, landing enough shots and avoided anything Wilder could throw. In round 12, Wilder landed a right-left combination which put Fury down hard on his back. The crowd, commentary team and Wilder believed the fight was over. Reiss looked at Fury on the canvas and began giving him a count. To everyone's surprise, Fury beat the count. Reiss made Fury walk towards him and called for the action to continue. Wilder, fatigued again, was unable to land another power shot and Fury landed some right hands to finish the round and the fight on his feet. Both boxers embraced in a hug after the final bell sounded.According to CompuBox statistics, Wilder landed 71 punches of 430 thrown (17%), and Fury landed 84 of his 327 thrown (26%). Wilder was much less accurate in this fight than he usually had been in previous fights. Fury out-landed Wilder in 9 out of the 12 rounds. Both Wilder and Fury only landed double digits in 4 separate rounds. After the fight, both men gave in-ring interviews. Wilder stated, ""I think with the two knockdowns, I definitely won the fight. We poured our hearts out tonight. We're both warriors. I rushed my punches. I didn't sit still. I was too hesitant. I started overthrowing the right hand, and I just couldn't adjust. I was rushing my punches. That's something I usually don't do."" Fury said, ""We're on away soil. I got knocked down twice, but I still believe I won that fight. I'm being a total professional here. God bless America. The 'Gypsy King' has returned. That man is a fearsome puncher, and I was able to avoid that. The world knows I won the fight. I hope I did you all proud after nearly three years out of the ring. I showed good heart to get up. I came here tonight, and I fought my heart out."" Wilder and Fury both claimed to be the best heavyweights in the world and both called out unified world champion Anthony Joshua. Fury shouted, ""Chicken! Chicken! Joshua, where are you?"" Wilder then agreed to state the two best heavyweights got into the ring and fought.The event was both a critical and a commercial success. The fight sold approximately 325,000 pay-per-view buys on Showtime in the United States, grossing around $24 million, making it the most lucrative heavyweight fight in the country since 2003. Showtime's delayed broadcast a week later drew an average 488,000 viewers and peaked at 590,000 viewers. Despite the commercial success of the fight, promoter Bob Arum believes it was meagre in comparison to the bout's potential. Arum said Fury vs. Wilder II could surpass Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, which grossed over $600 million, saying: ""They were the little guys, here we have the biggest men in the sport.""

Establishing himself in Las Vegas
Fury vs. Schwarz
After the fight with Wilder, Fury secured a five-fight contract with ESPN and Top Rank worth 80 million ($100 million). He made his return to the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas against the WBO Inter-Continental heavyweight champion Tom Schwarz (240, 16 KOs) on 15 June 2019. This was Fury's first fight in Las Vegas. Schwarz was ranked #2 by the WBO and #9 by the IBF at the time. Fury weighed 263 pounds (119 kg), compared to Schwarz's 235+12 pounds (106.8 kg). He was in complete control of the fight, peppering the undefeated Schwarz in round one before finishing him in the second round by TKO, to take Schwarz's WBO Inter-Continental title. During the fight, Fury purposely backed up against the ropes and let Schwarz unload, using head movement to evade the strikes and generating applause from the 9,000 people in attendance.

Fury vs. Wallin
Fury fought again in Las Vegas against former WBA Continental heavyweight champion Otto Wallin (200, 13 KOs) on 14 September, at the T-Mobile Arena. Promoter Frank Warren said: ""It is another undefeated boxer he is facing and a contest where a victory will set up the Deontay Wilder rematch."" Wallin was ranked #4 by the WBA and #12 by the IBF at heavyweight. Fury scaled at 254.4 pounds (115.4 kg), his lightest since facing Klitschko in 2015, when he weighed 247 pounds (112 kg). The Swedish southpaw Wallin came in at exactly 236 pounds (107 kg). Fury won by unanimous decision 116112, 117111, and 118110. Fury suffered a serious cut above his right eye in the third round from a short left hook, as well as a cut over his right eyelid from an accidental clash of heads in the fifth which affected his vision for the rest of the fight and prompted a ringside doctor to be consulted in the sixth. After an examination, Fury said he was able to continue and the doctor agreed. In the second half of the fight, Fury repeatedly hit Wallin with solid shots. Wallin came back in the twelfth with his best punch of the fight, a clean left hand which momentarily troubled Fury. After tying Wallin up in a clinch, Fury saw out the round, receiving the decision victory and the WBC Mayan belt, a commemorative title awarded to the winner of a high-profile fight held during Mexican national holidays. According to CompuBox, Fury landed 179 of 651 total punches (27%) while Wallin connected with 127 of 334 total punches (38%). Of these total punches, Fury landed 127 power punches to Wallin's 84. In his in-ring interview, Fury praised the performance of Wallin, who was a more than 101 underdog, and expressed condolences as Wallin's father had recently died. Fury then called out Wilder for a rematch in February 2020.

WBC and The Ring heavyweight champion
Fury vs. Wilder II
On 27 November 2019, ESPN announced that Fury would face Deontay Wilder on 22 February 2020, in a rematch of their bout in 2018, which resulted in a controversial draw. In the build-up to the rematch, Fury split with trainer Ben Davison, who had coached Fury since late 2017 and helped him lose the large amount of weight he had gained during his hiatus and restore him to fighting condition. Davison was nominated for 2018 Trainer of the Year due to his role in Fury's successful return to the ring. The split was described as amicable and Davison wished Fury good luck in the rematch against Wilder. Fury then announced he had partnered with SugarHill Steward, nephew of Hall-of-Fame trainer Emanuel Steward, and that he would return to Kronk Gym, where he briefly trained in 2010. The rematch was officially announced on 27 December 2019, and the venue was set as the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The fight contract included a clause in which the loser can invoke a trilogy fight if he chooses.Fury weighed in at 273 pounds (124 kg), the third heaviest weight of his professional career and 17 pounds (7.7 kg) heavier than his weight for the first Wilder bout. He stated in the lead-up to the fight that he wanted extra size and power to look for a knockout. Wilder weighed in at 231 pounds (105 kg), the heaviest of his career. Fury started the fight by taking the centre of the ring and establishing his jab. He looked for some big shots, while evading Wilder's swings. In the third round, Fury floored Wilder with a strong right hand to the temple. Wilder beat the count and survived the round but was visibly disoriented, as blood began to stream from his left ear. Wilder fell to the canvas twice more, but they were ruled as slips by the referee Kenny Bayless, before Fury knocked Wilder down again in the fifth round with a quick combination punctuated by a left hook to the body. Wilder made it to his feet again, but was unable to muster much in the way of a counterattack and he was now bleeding from the mouth as well as the ear. The fight was stopped midway through the seventh round after a flurry of hard-hitting shots from Fury caused Wilder's corner to throw in the towel to save him from further punishment. At the time of stoppage, Fury was ahead on all three judges' scorecards 5952, 5853, and 5952, with the irregular scores due to Bayless deducting a point from Fury in the fifth for holding. According to CompuBox, Fury landed 82 of his 267 total punches (31%), including 58 out of 160 power punches (36%). Wilder landed 34 of his 141 total punches (24%), including 18 out of 55 power punches (33%).According to CompuBox, Fury landed 82 of his 267 total punches (31%), including 58 out of 160 power punches (36%). Wilder landed 34 of his 141 total punches (24%), including 18 out of 55 power punches (33%). Fury received widespread praise for his performance, with many believing that it established one of the best boxing comeback stories ever seen, and some stating that the victory placed him as one of the greatest heavyweight boxers in history. It made him the first man to defeat two champions who had 10 or more defences of their world championship (Klitschko with 18 defences, and Wilder with 10 defences). Fury also became the third heavyweight, after Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson, to hold The Ring magazine title twice, and the first heavyweight in history to have held the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO, and The Ring magazine titles. With a gate of $16,916,440, the fight broke the gate record for a heavyweight bout in Nevada set by Evander Holyfield vs. Lennox Lewis II in November 1999.

Fury vs. Wilder III
Deontay Wilder activated the clause for a second rematch fight with Tyson Fury after his loss to Fury in the first rematch. The trilogy fight was tentatively scheduled for July 2020, but this was later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 11 June 2020, Anthony Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn announced that Fury and Joshua had agreed a two-fight deal, provided that Fury defeated Wilder and Joshua defeated his mandatory challenger, Kubrat Pulev. Fury's promoter Bob Arum said in August 2020, ""the WBC approved the trilogy contract and that provides for postponements. And certainly, if you can't do it with spectators, a reasonable postponement would be okay. It's a different kind of fight.""On 12 October 2020, Fury announced that he was foregoing a trilogy fight with Wilder after organizers failed to deliver a date for the event in 2020. The Athletic reported ""Fury had every intention of fighting Wilder in 2020 and made several concessions regarding rescheduled dates. However, he was unwilling to allow this situation to drag out, delaying a series of fights with Joshua while also keeping him out of the ring for an extended period of time.""On 17 May 2021, the proposed unification fight between Fury and Joshua was thrown into serious doubt when arbitration judge Daniel Weinstein ruled that Fury will have to honour a contractual clause which mandates a third fight with Wilder. Subsequently, Bob Arum claimed that the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas had been reserved for 24 July in anticipation of Fury's trilogy fight with Wilder. On 22 May 2021, Fury announced during the broadcast of Jos Ramrez vs. Josh Taylor on ESPN that he had signed the contract for the Wilder trilogy fight, which ESPN showed footage of Fury signing. It was also confirmed by Wilder's manager Shelly Finkel that his fighter had signed the contract, and that the fight was on. Ahead of their pre-fight press conference on 15 June, the venue was officially confirmed as T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, where Fury had previously defeated Otto Wallin by unanimous decision on 14 September 2019. The bout was postponed from the original date of 24 July until 9 October, after Fury's camp had an outbreak of COVID-19. At the pre-fight weigh-in on 8 October, both men weighed in at their respective career-heaviest weights, with the champion Fury weighing in at 277 lbs (19 st 11 lb), and the challenger Wilder at 238 lbs (17 st).On the night, both men exchanged a total of five knockdowns as Fury won the bout via eleventh-round knockout. Wilder had started the first round well, jabbing the champion to the body and landing several clean right hands to his chest and stomach, doing enough to win the first round on all three judges' scorecards. In the second, Fury landed some good shots in the clinch. Midway through the third, Fury sent Wilder to the canvas with a series of hard right hands, and continued to pummel him as Wilder was effectively saved by the bell. Wilder came back in the fourth with a vicious short right hand that put Fury down on the canvas. Wilder continued coming forwards, and sent the champion down again towards the end of the round. In the middle rounds, Fury recovered and started landing with more regularity, racking up a commanding lead on the cards and marking up Wilder's face badly, with the latter now visibly exhausted as a result of all of the punishment he had taken. In the tenth, Wilder was decked by a huge right hook, but came back yet again with a huge series of wild swings that caught Fury at the bell. With Wilder badly hurt and bleeding, Fury managed to finish his opponent in the eleventh round with a clean right hook thrown from the clinch. Referee Robert Mora waved the contest off with Wilder face-down on the canvas. After the fight, Fury praised his opponent, calling Wilder a ""top fighter"", but criticised him for being a ""sore loser"" and refusing to ""show any sportsmanship or respect"". In his post-fight interview, Fury stated ""I'm a sportsman. I went over to him to show some love and respect and he didn't show it back. I will pray for him so that God will soften his heart."" Fury then added that it ""was a great fight tonight, worthy of the best of trilogies."" Fury asserted his view that he is the best boxer in his division, stating ""I'm now the greatest heavyweight of my era, without a doubt.""At the time of the stoppage, Fury was winning the bout on all three scorecards with 9591, 9492, and 9592. According to CompuBox, Fury landed 150 of 385 punches (39%), while Wilder connected with 72 of 355 punches (20%). The 150 punches landed on Wilder is the most ever landed by an opponent. Despite the back and forth nature of the bout, CompuBox calculated Fury as having outlanded Wilder in every single round of the fight, including the fourth round in which Fury was knocked down twice. The fight was widely acclaimed by observers and pundits for its action and high-level intensity: hall-of-fame promoter Bob Arum said, ""I've been in this business 57 years promoting fights and I have to say I've truly never seen a heavyweight fight as magnificent as this"", while the Ring magazine described it as ""the obvious fight of the year so far"" and ""a rare and historic heavyweight championship trilogy"".

Fury vs. Whyte
On 30 December 2021, WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman, who had ordered Fury to defend his WBC title against mandatory challenger Dillian Whyte, ruled that Fury as the reigning champion would be entitled to 80% of the purse, compared to Whyte's 20% as the challenger. Sulaiman had set a deadline of 11 January 2022 for purse bids, as the two fighters' camps could not agree to terms. However, this deadline was pushed back multiple times, in part due to ongoing negotiations from Fury's team who were trying to secure the fight for the undisputed heavyweight championship against undefeated WBA (Super), IBF and WBO heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk. A fight between Fury and Usyk did not materialise, as deposed former champion Anthony Joshua was unwilling to step aside to allow the two champions to fight.The deadline for the Fury-Whyte purse bids was ultimately scheduled for 28 January 2022, when it was announced that Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions had won the rights to promote the fight, with a winning bid of $41,025,000 (31 million), beating out the $32,222,222 (24 million) bid submitted by Eddie Hearn's Matchroom. Warren's bid was reported to be the highest successful purse bid in boxing history. Fury reacted to the news, stating on social media that he is ""coming home"", suggesting that the fight against Whyte would be the first time he would box on U.K. soil since his August 2018 win against Francesco Pianeta. On 25 February, it was officially announced that the fight would be taking place at Wembley Stadium in London, England on 23 April.The first press conference for the fight took place on 1 March at Wembley Stadium, with Whyte absent. Whyte's lawyer stated that his client would not be partaking in promoting the fight, as ""we still do not have things resolved"". Despite his opponent's non-attendance, Fury as usual was ""in full showman mode"", declaring, ""Even Tyson Fury versus his own shadow sells"", and promising that the fight ""is going to be a Ferrari racing a Vauxhall Corsa"". When asked about Whyte's no-show, Fury opined, ""He's definitely shown the white flag in my estimation."" In addition, he stated that his bout against Whyte would be the final fight of his professional career, promising to retire after the fight: ""I'm a two-time undisputed world champion. [I have] 150m in the bank and nothing to prove to anybody.""Tickets for the fight went on sale on 2 March. 85,000 of the 90,000 available tickets were sold within the first 3 hours, prompting Fury's promoter Frank Warren to begin the process of applying to the local authorities to expand the capacity to 100,000 fans, which would make Fury-Whyte the largest post-war boxing attendance in the history of the United Kingdom. The contest ultimately took place in front of a record-breaking crowd of 94,000 fans: 4,000 more than the attendance of Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko which also took place at Wembley Stadium in 2017, thus setting a new attendance record for a boxing match in Europe.Fury was given a rousing reception by the crowd as he made his way to the ring in an attire of red and white, paying homage to Saint George's Day to the backdrop of ""Juicy"" by The Notorious B.I.G. and ""Sex on Fire"" by Kings of Leon, in contrast to the boos received by his opponent Whyte during his own ring-walk. Whyte unexpectedly boxed the first round in the southpaw stance, which was unusual for the primarily orthodox fighter. After a cautious first three minutes, Fury returned the favour at the start of the second round by switching between the southpaw and orthodox stances. The champion found success with the jab and check hook. In the fourth round, Whyte was cut over his right eye after a clash of heads. Fury continued to dominate the fight, landing a straight right in the fifth round which appeared to momentarily stun the challenger. With around ten seconds left of the sixth round, Fury landed a left jab, followed by a right uppercut which sent Whyte sprawling to the canvas. Although Whyte was able to beat the count and rise to his feet, the referee deemed it unsafe for him to continue, halting the fight after two minutes and fifty-nine seconds of the sixth round, declaring Fury the winner by sixth-round technical knockout. At the time of the stoppage, Fury was winning the bout on all three scorecards with 4946, 4847, and 5045.In his post-fight ring interview, Fury claimed that the fight against Whyte was the last of his professional boxing career: ""I've been in this game 20 years, I'm 34 in a few months. I said the third Wilder fight would be my last but I felt I owed the fans one last homecoming. This is definitely the end of the Gypsy King and I went out with a bang. Tonight was amazing but this is the end."" Fury appeared to have no regrets, stating, ""I fulfilled everything I've ever wanted to fulfil. I will retire as only the second heavyweight in history, after Rocky Marciano, to retire undefeated. I was unbeatable at this game.""He announced his retirement on 12 August 2022 and relinquished his Ring title.

Fury vs. Chisora III
On 20 October 2022, it was announced that Fury would return from his short-lived retirement to defend his WBC title against Derek Chisora in a trilogy bout on 3 December at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, live on BT Sport Box Office.On the night of the fight, Fury defeated Chisora via 10th-round TKO in front of a crowd of 60,000 fans, in a dominant performance. After the fight, Fury called on fellow undefeated heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk, who was seated ringside at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, to join him between the ropes. Usyk obliged, stepping up to the ropes before facing a barrage of abuse from Fury, who indicated his preference to face Usyk as his next opponent. Fury suggested that if the Usyk fight could not be made next for whatever reason, he would be happy to face WBO interim champion Joe Joyce, who had also joined Fury and Usyk ringside post-fight.

Fury vs. Ngannou
Fury is set to face former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on October 28. WBC officials confirmed the fight will be ten rounds and count as an official bout, although Fury's title will not be at stake.

Professional wrestling
Fury made an appearance in an angle on WWE's debut of SmackDown on Fox on 4 October 2019. Appearing as a fan, he stared down Braun Strowman during his match, and Strowman later threw one of his opponents, Dolph Ziggler, at Fury. After the match, Fury jumped the barricade, but was stopped by security. On 11 October, it was confirmed that Fury and Strowman would have a match at WWE Crown Jewel. At Crown Jewel on 31 October, Fury defeated Strowman via countout. Fury reportedly earned 11.9 million ($15 million) for his participation. Fury later made an appearance on the 8 November episode of SmackDown at the Manchester Arena, shaking hands with Strowman and suggesting they form a tag team together before both being challenged by the B-Team (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel), who they left laying in the ring.On 3 September 2022, Fury was in the audience of WWE Clash at the Castle. During the main event between Roman Reigns and Drew McIntyre, Fury prevented Austin Theory from interfering by knocking him out. After the match, Fury helped the defeated McIntyre up, then after assuring him that he did well, the two led the crowd into some songs.

Other ventures
In September 2019, Penguin Random House imprint Century secured the publishing rights to Fury's autobiography, titled Behind the Mask: My Autobiography. It was released on 14 November 2019 and reached the number-one bestseller position on Amazon with 24 hours of its release. His second book, entitled The Furious Method, was published in 2020. A self-help book, it is ""full of inspirational advice for readers on how we can all improve our physical and mental health"". The book was a commercial success, and is a Sunday Times bestseller.Fury appeared in a four-part ITV documentary named Meet the Furys, which followed the Fury family while Tyson was preparing to fight in Las Vegas for the first time. ITV later commissioned another documentary about Fury, titled Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King, which showed Fury and his family during the build-up to the Wilder rematch. A Netflix series about Fury and his family, ""At Home with the Furys"", was released 16 August 2023.Known for his habit of impromptu singing, Fury regularly gained media attention for singing songs in the boxing ring after matches and during promotional events. In 2019, Fury appeared as a guest vocalist on English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams' studio album The Christmas Present, for the song ""Bad Sharon"".  On 11 November 2022, Fury released a cover of ""Sweet Caroline"" as a single to raise money for the men's mental health charity, Talk Club.Fury has expressed an interest in competing in mixed martial arts. In November 2019, he had a training session with Darren Till, who said there is a 70% chance that Fury will compete in MMA. Fury also mentioned that Conor McGregor has offered to train him should he crossover to MMA.On 16 February 2022, Fury launched a new range of energy drinks named Furocity Energy to rival market leaders Red Bull and Monster Energy. He has since released Furocity ice lollies, energy gum, and protein bars.

Public image
After Fury became world champion in 2015, the British media began to scrutinise what he had said in the past. He received criticism for having said that he would ""hang"" his sister if she was promiscuous, as well as comments made in an interview before the Klitschko fight in which he denounced abortion, paedophilia, and homosexuality, saying that the legalisation of these behaviours would bring forth a Biblical reckoning.Fury was nominated for the 2015 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award but around 140,000 people signed a petition claiming that his equation of homosexuality with paedophilia should disqualify him. When asked about the petition by a BBC journalist, Fury quoted religious phrases, including ""believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved,"" along with John 3:16: ""For God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten Son, whoever believes in Him shall have eternal life and shall not perish."" Fury ultimately came fourth in the SPOTY award and said at the ceremony, ""I've said a lot of stuff in the past and none of it is with intentions to hurt anybody. I apologise to anyone that's been hurt by it."" He also was criticised for comments on bestiality, transgender people, and ""Zionist Jewish people who own all the banks, all the papers, all the TV stations"" in a May 2016 interview. The interview was later deleted and Fury apologised: ""I said some things which may have hurt some people, which as a Christian man is not something I would ever want to do. Though it is not an excuse, sometimes the heightened media scrutiny has caused me to act out in public and then my words can get taken out of context. I mean no harm or disrespect to anyone and I know more is expected of me as an ambassador of British boxing and I promise in future to hold myself up to the highest possible standard.""Fury was formerly known for his attention-grabbing antics, such as arriving at a press conference in a Lamborghini and wearing a Batman costume. After his hiatus, he has said that he does not want to ""play a character anymore"". He stated in November 2017, ""I feel I have a story to tell, a massive one. The stuff I've been through, depression, mental health problems. It can help and inspire others. From 18 stone to 27. From a clean living man to drugs and alcohol and back to the heavyweight world champion again. I hope the legacy and story I leave behind will help others in the future of what to do and not to do."" Although Fury has vowed to rein in his entertaining behaviour, he is still known for his vibrant personality, with promoter Bob Arum stating that he ""hasn't seen a fighter with that much charisma since Muhammad Ali"". Since his return to the ring and his strong performance against Wilder, Fury has been dubbed ""The People's Champion"" due to his open and honest discussion about his mental health struggles. He is currently an Ambassador for the former British world champion Frank Bruno's mental health charity, The Frank Bruno Foundation.In June 2020, Fury publicly thanked Daniel Kinahan for his role in brokering a potential Tyson Fury vs. Anthony Joshua fight. In 2018, an Irish High Court judge stated that Kinahan, who has no previous criminal convictions, is a senior figure in organised crime on a global scale. The Irish government expressed its ""outrage"" over the involvement of Kinahan in the brokering of the proposed fight. On 24 June 2020, it was announced that Fury had parted ways with Kinahan as an advisor. However, in June 2022, Fury was refused entry to the United States, apparently a result of his links with Kinahan.

Personal life
Fury met his wife Paris (ne Mullroy) when she was 15 and he was 17. They began dating the year after they met, and married in 2008 at St. Peter in Chains Catholic Church in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. The couple have six children together: three sons (all named Prince) and three daughters. When Fury was asked why all of his sons had the first name Prince, he said, ""I'm a king and they're princes until they earn their rightful name."" He named his first son Prince after Prince Naseem, his favourite British fighter. Paris suffered a miscarriage before Fury's cancelled bout with Ustinov in 2014, and lost another child on the day of his comeback fight against Seferi in 2018.Fury's mother was a Protestant and his father is a Catholic, though neither actively practised their religions; he was instead introduced to religion by his uncle, a born-again Christian and Pentecostal preacher in the Irish Traveller community. The Guardian described Fury's beliefs as ""a mixture of traditional Roman Catholic ... and a particularly literal interpretation of evangelical Christianity"". His wife is a practising Catholic and was also raised in an Irish Traveller family.
Fury and his family reside in Morecambe, Lancashire. He also owns a home in Las Vegas, but decided to let his boxing trainer live there because he is unsure about spending more time in the US. In September 2015, he expressed an interest in running to be an independent MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, stating that the government was too focused on providing services for immigrants and not enough on homeless people and those with drug and alcohol problems.In April 2016, Fury spoke about the racial abuse he receives as an Irish Traveller, stating that ""no one wants to see a Gypsy do well"". He stated, ""I am a Gypsy and that's it. I will always be a Gypsy, I'll never change. I will always be fat and white and that's it. I am the champion yet I am thought of as a bum."" Since his return from his hiatus, Fury has stated that he still feels bias against his community.Fury is a fan of Manchester United F.C. and attends football matches at their home ground Old Trafford. He also supports the England national team.

Tyson Fury at BoxRec (registration required)
Tyson Fury at Tapology.com","Tyson Luke Fury (born 12 August 1988) is a British professional boxer. He has held the World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight title since 2020. Previously, he held the unified heavyweight titles from 2015 to 2016, and the Ring magazine title twice between 2015 and 2022. He also held the International Boxing Organization (IBO) title during his first reign as champion.
With his defeat of Deontay Wilder, Fury became the third heavyweight, after Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali, to hold The Ring magazine title twice, and is widely considered by media outlets to be the lineal heavyweight champion. As of December 2022, Fury is ranked as the world's best active heavyweight by BoxRec and ESPN, he is also ranked sixth pound-for-pound by ESPN and the Boxing Writers Association of America, and seventh by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board.As an amateur, Fury represented both England and Ireland, as he was born in Manchester to an Irish Traveller family. Fury's family lineage comes from Belfast and Galway; his parents emigrated to England at a young age. He won the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008 before turning professional later that year at 20 years of age. After winning the English heavyweight title twice, he became the British and Commonwealth champion in 2011 by defeating the 140 Derek Chisora. He then won the Irish and WBO Inter-Continental titles, before defeating Chisora again in a 2014 rematch for the European and WBO International heavyweight titles. This success, along with his 240 record, set up a match with the long-reigning world champion Wladimir Klitschko in Germany, which Fury won by unanimous decision.
Fury was stripped of his IBF title 10 days after the Klitschko bout as he was unable to grant a fight with the IBF's mandatory challenger, Vyacheslav Glazkov, due to a rematch clause in his contract with Klitschko. The rematch did not materialise as Fury had mental health issues leading to alcoholism, recreational drug use and extreme weight gain. In 2016, he vacated the WBA, WBO and IBO titles; The Ring stripped him of his last remaining title in early 2018. Later that year, after more than two years of inactivity, Fury challenged for the WBC heavyweight title against Wilder. The fight was controversially scored as a draw. Fury's strong performance against Wilder (including recovering from a heavy knockdown in the final round) earned him Comeback of the Year from The Ring and numerous other awards. In the rematch in February 2020, Fury defeated Wilder by a technical knockout in the seventh round after a dominant performance. He knocked out Wilder again in the trilogy fight in October 2021, this time in the eleventh round.",68468,2685,francis ngannou,20,12,0,3,0,0.24,"Francis Zavier Ngannou (born 5 September 1986) is a Cameroonian-French professional mixed martial artist and professional boxer who is currently signed to the Professional Fighters League (PFL). He also competed in the Heavyweight division in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), where he was the reigning UFC Heavyweight Champion at the time of his departure from the promotion.

Early life and education
Ngannou was born and raised in the village of Bati, Cameroon. He lived in poverty and had little formal education growing up. Ngannou's parents divorced when he was six years old, and he was sent to live with his aunt. At 10 years old, Ngannou started working in a sand quarry in Bati because of a lack of funds. As a youngster, he was approached by several gangs in his village to join them. However, Ngannou refused and instead decided to use his father's negative reputation as a street fighter as motivation to do something positive and pursue boxing.At age 22, Ngannou began training in boxing, despite the initial reluctance of his family. After training for a year, Ngannou stopped training due to an illness. He did various odd jobs to make ends meet, until age 26 when he decided to head to Paris, France, to pursue professional boxing. However upon reaching Europe, he was jailed for two months in Spain for illegally crossing the border. After Ngannou reached Paris, he had no money, no friends, and no place to live. After living homeless on the streets of Paris, he met Francis Carmont who introduced him to Fernand Lopez and the MMA factory. Being a fan of Mike Tyson, Ngannou was originally interested in learning how to box but Lopez saw his potential in MMA and convinced him to try MMA instead. Lopez gave Ngannou some MMA gear and allowed him to train and sleep at the gym for no cost thus starting Ngannou's MMA career.
Reflecting on his journey across continents and his decision to become an MMA fighter, Ngannou said:When I started, I had nothing. Nothing. I needed everything. But when you start [to earn money], you starting collecting things: I want this, I want this, I want that. The purpose is not collecting things, though. The purpose is to do something great. Finish the dream you started.
I want to help my family, first, of course, but then I want to give opportunity to children in my country like me who have a dream to become a doctor or something. If I reach my dream, it will give me the opportunity to help those in my country who have their own dreams and nothing else to fulfill them.
I want to give some opportunity for children like me who dream of this sport and don't have an opportunity like me. The last time I was in Cameroon, I brought a lot of materials for boxing and MMA to open a gym. Now I just bought a big space to start the gym, as well.

A lot of children now in Cameroon, because of me, they have a dream. They say, 'I will be a champion in MMA. I will do boxing like Francis,' because they saw me when I was young. I didn't have anything. I didn't have any opportunity. And today, they see me, and they are dreaming. They are thinking that something is possible. Even when they are so poor, something is possible in life.  It's not easy. It's so hard, but it's possible.

As an amateur he became the first Brazilian boxer to win an Olympic gold medal at the 2016 Olympics.

Amateur career
Born in Salvador, capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia, Conceio started boxing at the age of 13 to stand his own in street fights. He had to walk 9 kilometers to his academy due to not having money for bus tickets, woke up early in the morning to help his grandmother who sold groceries, and helped his family by selling ice cream and being a kitchen helper. His first coach was Luiz Drea, who also managed world champion Acelino Freitas, Olympic medallist Adriana Arajo, and MMA fighter Junior dos Santos.Just four months after entering the Brazilian boxing team, Conceio fought the qualifiers for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. While he fell in the first American qualifier to Idel Torriente, Conceio won all fights to get an Olympic spot. He eventually lost his opening match to Li Yang.After losing in the first round of the 2009 World Amateur Boxing Championships, in 2011 Conceio won two bouts before a close decision 18:19 to the eventual winner Vasyl Lomachenko. That same year he got a silver medal at the 2011 Pan American Games, losing the final to eventual Olympic medalist Yasniel Toledo and guaranteeing a second Olympic spot.  During the Pan Ams, Conceio proposed to his girlfriend, fellow boxer rica Matos, whom he married in 2013.
