win,dec,12,mexico,2023,5,6,canelo alvarez,1990,173,179,0,mexico,58,39,2,2,0,0.03,"Santos Sal ""Canelo"" lvarez Barragn (American Spanish: [saul alaes]; born 18 July 1990) is a Mexican professional boxer. He has won multiple world championships in four weight classes from light middleweight to light heavyweight, including unified titles in three of those weight classes and lineal titles in two. lvarez is the first and only boxer in history to become undisputed champion at super middleweight, having held the WBA (Super), WBC and Ring magazine titles since 2020, and the IBF and WBO titles since 2021.
lvarez is known as an excellent counterpuncher, being able to exploit openings in his opponents' guards while avoiding punches with head and body movement. He is also known as a formidable body puncher. As of May 2022, lvarez is ranked as the world's best active boxer, pound for pound, by BoxRec and the Boxing Writers Association of America, fourth by ESPN, fifth by the TBRB, and sixth by The Ring. He is also ranked as the world's best active super middleweight by BoxRec, The Ring, TBRB, and ESPN.

Early life
In an interview, lvarez explained that he was born on the outskirts of Guadalajara, Jalisco, but his family is originally from Los Reyes, Michoacn. At the age of five, his family moved to their current home of Juanacatln, Jalisco. Growing up on his family's farm, he learned horseback riding, which he continues today. lvarez is the youngest of eight children, seven of them boys; all of his brothers also became professional boxers. Among his brothers are welterweight boxers Ramn lvarez, Ricardo lvarez and former WBA interim world champion, Rigoberto lvarez.Canelo in Spanish is the masculine word for cinnamon, which is a common nickname for people with red hair. His mother, Ana Maria, also has red hair. In Mexico, it is common for people to associate red hair with the Irish soldiers who fought for Mexico in the Saint Patrick's Battalion during the MexicanAmerican War. Speaking about his ancestry, lvarez once said, ""There might have been an Irish grandfather somewhere back in my past.""
He was bullied at an early age when he would be called ""Jcama con Chile"", which translates as jicama with chilli flakes  a popular snack in Mexico.

Amateur career
lvarez started boxing when he was around 13 years old, after watching his older brother Rigoberto debut as a professional boxer. In 2004, he won the silver medal at the Junior Mexican National Championships, held in Sinaloa. He became the 2005 Junior Mexican National Boxing Champion in Tuxtla Gutirrez, Chiapas, at the age of 15. His amateur record was 442 with 12 knockouts.

Professional career
Early career
lvarez turned professional at 15, shortly after his championship at the Junior Nationals, because his trainers at the time, father-and-son team Chepo and Eddy Reynoso, were unable to find suitable junior opponents for him. In his first 19 months as a professional, he knocked out eleven of his 13 documented opponents, all of whom were significantly older. However, the elder Reynoso stated in 2013 that lvarez had fought ten more times in that span, winning all ten by knockout (KO), but that these fights (all in small venues in the Mexican state of Nayarit) were so poorly documented that it was not worth the trouble to seek to have the record corrected. This means that his actual record is 6722 with 49 knockouts. His weight fluctuated in his three years as a professional including two documented fights within the light welterweight limit of 140 lbs before he settled in the welterweight division at 147 lbs.lvarez's third official bout of his career was a win over future IBF lightweight champion Miguel Vzquez on 20 January 2006, in his home town of Guadalajara, Jalisco. On 28 June 2008, lvarez defeated Vzquez again in a rematch. He also made world history on that fight card when he and all six of his brothers fought on the same night, with Canelo being the youngest. The only downside was that three of them failed to win their pro debuts. The other four more experienced brothers won. On 6 March 2010, he got a crushing third-round KO over Brian Camechis in Tuxtla Gutirrez, Chiapas. lvarez then defeated Jos Cotto on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Shane Mosley to retain his WBC-NABF welterweight title.

Light middleweight
His sixth-round technical knockout (TKO) win over Luciano Leonel Cuello for the WBC Silver light middleweight title was held at the Vicente Fernndez Arena. During the post-fight interview, Mexican singer Vicente Fernndez gave lvarez a horse. He was also given a horse by the mayor of Tepic, where lvarez sometimes trains.He next faced the former WBC welterweight champion Carlos Baldomir at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, on the Shane Mosley vs. Sergio Mora undercard. Baldomir stated in a pre-fight interview that he wanted the winner of Mora vs. Mosley, as he said ""after I knock out El Canelo."" Baldomir weighed in at 153.4 lbs for the bout, that was contracted for 151 lbs. In California, if a fighter is overweight he is penalized 20% of his purse and that percent is given to the other fighter. However, lvarez declined to take the extra $12,000 from Baldomir. In the sixth round, lvarez landed a crushing blow that knocked Baldomir out cold. With the victory, lvarez became just the second boxer ever to stop Carlos Baldomir and the first boxer ever to knock him out. lvarez then successfully defended his light middleweight title by unanimous decision against former world champion Lovemore N'dou in Veracruz. It was a competitive fight despite the wide margins on the official scorecards of 119109, 120108, and 120108.
lvarez was in line as mandatory challenger for the winner of the vacant WBC light middleweight title bout between Manny Pacquiao and Antonio Margarito, however, Pacquiao who was the victor, wrote to the WBC stating he had no intention of defending the title and it was declared vacant. On 5 March 2011, lvarez defeated European welterweight champion Matthew Hatton via unanimous decision, for the vacant WBC light middleweight belt. The bout was televised on HBO and took place at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. lvarez was docked a point in the seventh round, which was uniformly scored 99, for hitting after the break. All three ringside judges scored the bout 119108 in favor of lvarez, who landed 47% of his 626 punches, including 53% of his power shots. Hatton connected with just 25% of his 546 total blows in a fight that averaged 1.4 million viewers on HBO.lvarez successfully defended his newly awarded WBC title against #4 ranked Ring light middleweight and current European light middleweight champion Ryan Rhodes. lvarez defeated Rhodes via TKO in the twelfth round on 18 June 2011, in Guadalajara, Jalisco. The fight averaged 1.6 million viewers on HBO.On 17 September 2011, lvarez successfully defended that same WBC title against The Contender competitor Alfonso Gmez at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, winning via TKO in the sixth round. Gmez won a majority of the first five rounds after lvarez knocked him down in the first round. lvarez was looking for one shot and got it in the sixth round when he backed Gmez up with a right hand. He then followed up with a flurry to get the referee to jump in and stop the fight.

lvarez vs. Cintrn
lvarez defeated Kermit Cintrn via TKO in the fifth round. lvarez spent the first three rounds feeling out his opponent Cintrn, a former welterweight champion, before punishing the Puerto Rican with body shots and straight right hands in the fourth round. He knocked Cintrn down once and had him in trouble at the end of the round, but Cintrn was saved by the bell. In the fifth round, Cintrn came out and caught lvarez with some combinations, but lvarez eventually overpowered him with several powerful straight right hands and the referee stepped in and stopped it. The fight averaged 1.5 million viewers on HBO: Boxing After Dark.

lvarez vs. Mosley
Richard Schaefer announced that lvarez's next bout would co-feature on the undercard of Miguel Cotto's clash with Floyd Mayweather Jr. at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. On 11 February 2012, Shane Mosley was announced as lvarez's next opponent in May for his WBC light middleweight title. lvarez defeated Mosley via unanimous decision after twelve rounds.

lvarez vs. Lpez
lvarez was originally set to fight top ten Ring light middleweight and former welterweight champion Paul Williams on 15 September 2012. However, on 27 May 2012, a motorcycle accident in the U.S. state of Georgia paralyzed Williams from the waist down, ending his boxing career. lvarez's possible opponents for his September bout were James Kirkland, Austin Trout, Delvin Rodriguez and most notably, Victor Ortiz.
lvarez was scheduled to defend his title against former welterweight titlist Victor Ortiz in the main event of a Showtime pay-per-view (PPV) card dubbed 'Knockout Kings' at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. However, on 23 June, Ortiz was unable to defeat underdog Josesito Lpez in what was supposed to be a ""tune-up"" fight at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, losing due to referee stoppage (broken jaw) and cancelling his bout with lvarez as a result.
Due to this upset, Lpez was instead penciled in to face Canelo at the MGM Grand on 15 September, for lvarez's WBC light middleweight title. lvarez won the fight via fifth-round TKO after dominating Lpez from start to finish, staying undefeated and increasing his record of 4101. The fight averaged 1.04 million on Showtime. Canelo earned $2 million for the fight and Lpez a smaller amount of $212,500.

lvarez vs. Trout
His next fight took place on 20 April 2013, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas against Austin Trout. The fight was supposed to take place during Cinco de Mayo weekend as the co-main event to Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Robert Guerrero; however, due to a contract disagreement between lvarez and Mayweather regarding their potential fight on 14 September 2013, lvarez opted to headline his own card instead.In front of 39,247 fans, lvarez successfully defended his WBC light middleweight title and won both the WBA (Regular) and vacant Ring light middleweight titles. During the first few rounds, Trout seemed to have a good game plan. However, lvarez's power took over after the third round, eventually scoring a knockdown in the seventh round to give Trout the first knockdown of his career. lvarez set up the knockdown with a pawing left jab, followed by the straight right hand. The fight was closer than expected, but lvarez still managed to dominate Trout throughout the fight with impressive head movement and shocking power. All three judges' scorecards were in favor of lvarez with a fair margin 115112 from Filipino judge Rey Danseco, 116111 from Texas' judge Oren Shellenberger, and 118109 from South African official Stanley Christodoulou. Although the last scorecard 118109 created controversy, the majority of sport analysts had lvarez winning by at least two points. CompuBox stats showed that Trout was the busier fighter, landing 154 of 769 punches thrown (20%) and lvarez was the more accurate puncher, landing 124 of his 431 thrown (29%). Immediately after the bout, Trout stated that he hadn't underestimated lvarez but that he trained to fight a completely different fighter.

lvarez vs. Mayweather
lvarez, Ring magazine's #1 ranked light middleweight and the unified WBA (Regular) and WBC champion, fought against Ring magazine's #1 pound-for-pound fighter, WBA (Super) light middleweight champion, WBC and Ring magazine welterweight champion, Floyd Mayweather Jr., on 14 September 2013. Mayweather held a world title at welterweight (147 lbs), but he also still owned a light middleweight title (154 lbs), which he won by outpointing Miguel Cotto in May 2012. He was moving back up in weight to face lvarez with their belts on the line, although the fight was contested at a catchweight of 152 lbs. The titles disputed for the bout were lvarez's WBC and Ring light middleweight titles and Mayweather's WBA (Super) light middleweight title. On fight night, Mayweather reportedly weighed 150 lbs and lvarez came in at 165 lbs.In front of a sold-out crowd of 16,746 at the MGM Garden, Mayweather defeated lvarez via majority decision. Judge C. J. Ross scored the fight 114114, a draw. Judge Dave Moretti had it 116112 and Craig Metcalfe scored it 117111. Judge Ross retired after this fight. Speaking of the controversial scorecard, Mayweather said, ""I can't control what the judges do."" CompuBox stats showed Mayweather's dominance in the fight. He landed 232 of 505 punches (46%) while lvarez connected on 117 of 526 thrown (22%). Mayweather earned a guaranteed $41.5 million to lvarez's $5 million.

Catchweight
lvarez vs. Angulo
On 9 January 2014, Golden Boy chief executive Richard Schaefer confirmed a deal had been made for a fight between lvarez and 31 year old Mexican boxer Alfredo Angulo (223, 18 KOs) to take place on 8 March 2014, on Showtime PPV at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. In March, ESPN reported the fight would take place at a catchweight of 155 lbs, due to lvarez not being able to make the light middleweight limit of 154 lbs. For the PPV fight, lvarez agreed to pay $100,000 of his minimum $1.25 million purse to Angulo, which would raise his purse $850,000. Also in the negotiations, lvarez agreed to weigh no more than 168 lbs on fight night. This was lvarez's first of five fights which took place at the 155-pound catchweight. On fight night, lvarez weighed 174 lbs on Showtime's scale and Angulo weighed 170 lbs. In front of 14,610 at the MGM, lvarez came out strong, throwing combinations. In a fairly lopsided beating, lvarez scored a tenth-round stoppage over Angulo punctuated by a lead left uppercut. The end of the fight began in round six, when Angulo's left eye started swelling. When the referee waived the fight off, the crowd was displeased and booed. At the time of stoppage, two judges had it 8982 and the third judge had it 8883, all in favor of lvarez.Angulo stated post-fight how he was unhappy with the stoppage, ""I told Tony he did the wrong job tonight. The referee tells us to take care of ourselves at all times. I can take care of myself. My plan was to work harder in the final four or three rounds. I had good preparation for this fight."" His trainer Virgil Hunter was also unhappy with referee Tony Weeks, ""I'm very upset. I told the referee and the doctor that if Canelo put two or three shots together that I would stop the fight. He landed one punch. Everyone knows Alfredo was coming on strong, everyone knows that.""

lvarez vs. Lara
lvarez fought Erislandy Lara on 12 July 2014, at the MGM Grand in a non-title match. Lara's WBA light middleweight title was not on the line, as the fight took place at a 155-pound catchweight and both fighters weighed in at precisely 155 lbs. lvarez rehydrated to 171 lbs while Lara came into the ring at 166 lbs. In a very close and competitive fight that went to a split decision, lvarez came out on top with two judges scoring 115113 in favor of each fighter and the final judge scoring 117111 in favor of lvarez. The final scorecard was controversial as many observers considered it far too wide. According to CompuBox, Lara landed 55 jabs to nine from lvarez, who landed the jab at a five percent connect rate. lvarez managed to land 88 power punches while Lara landed 53 power punches. Lara's clean punching, defense and movement were weighed against lvarez's effective aggressiveness and power punching. Lara came out in dominant fashion, utilizing a stick-and-move style and capturing the early rounds. Although lvarez struggled with Lara's one-two combinations, Lara's punches weren't thrown with sufficient power or frequency to dissuade him from consistently pressing the fight against a retreating Lara, and he was able to hammer away to Lara's body when he had him on the ropes. Lara's lead hand played a huge role in his one-two combination's effectiveness, but his output dropped as the fight progressed and he became increasingly tentative. lvarez was able to cut Lara with a lead left uppercut in the seventh round. Although the decision remains controversial, any talk of a rematch in the future was dismissed by Oscar De La Hoya who went on to say, ""No one wants a rematch.""

lvarez vs. Kirkland
In January 2015, Oscar De La Hoya announced that lvarez and James Kirkland (321, 28 KOs) had agreed to fight each other although no date or venue was set, in a non-title light middleweight bout. The reason why the date was not set was due to the upcoming Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao fight not having an official date. In March, at the official press conference, the fight was announced to take place at the Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas on 9 May 2015, live on HBO, a week after the 2 May fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao. It marked the first fight of lvarez's lucrative HBO contract. In front of 31,588, lvarez defeated Kirkland via third-round KO. Kirkland came out aggressively, but lvarez wobbled him and scored a knockdown via straight right hand in round one. In the third round, a counter right uppercut sent Kirkland to the canvas. lvarez ended the fight with a jab to the body quickly followed by the right hand, creating the KO. lvarez landed 87 of 150 punches thrown (58%) and Kirkland landed 42 of 197 (21%). After the bout, Kirkland said, ""I did not know I was knocked out."" He was then taken to hospital to undergo a CT scan. The win for lvarez set up a mega PPV fight between himself and WBC middleweight champion Miguel Cotto. The fight drew an average of 2.146 million viewers on HBO and peaked at 2.296 million, the highest viewership for HBO in 2015.

lvarez vs. Cotto
On 21 November 2015, lvarez won the WBC, Ring and lineal middleweight titles with a unanimous decision victory over Miguel Cotto in front of a sold-out crowd of 11,274 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. The fight took place at a catchweight of 155 lbs at Cotto's request. Although Cotto gave a tremendous effort, moving nicely throughout the fight, the judges clearly went for lvarez's superior power and accuracy, with surprisingly wide scores of 117111, 119109, and 118110. ESPN.com had the fight much closer, but still scored it in favour of lvarez, 115113. According to CompuBox, lvarez landed 155 of 484 punches (32%) and Cotto landed 129 of 629 (21%), with lvarez landing the heavier blows and inflicting more damage. Two months after the fight, the WBC awarded lvarez the WBC Diamond middleweight title at their headquarters in Mexico.
According to HBO, the fight generated 900,000 buys on PPV, which equated to around $58 million in domestic revenue. This was the first time since 2002, that a PPV generated 900,000 which didn't include Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya. That bout was a heavyweight title fight between Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson.

lvarez vs. Khan
In early 2016, it was announced that British boxer Amir Khan was moving up two weight divisions to fight lvarez at middleweight for his WBC, Ring and lineal middleweight titles. The fight took place on 7 May 2016, at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The bout was on HBO PPV. Khan kept his distance in the first five rounds, using his speed to come in and step out which initially caused trouble for lvarez. In round six, lvarez landed a devastating right hand that knocked out Khan. The fight generated a live gate of $7,417,350, according to figures released by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). That total came from 13,072 tickets sold, far short of a sell out. The lvarezKhan gross places it 34th-best in Nevada history. The fight drew close to 600,000 PPV buys.After the fight, lvarez and his team invited middleweight champion Gennady ""GGG"" Golovkin into the ring to promote a future fight between them. During the post-fight interview with HBO's Max Kellerman, lvarez stated, ""Let's fight now."" On 18 May 2016, lvarez vacated the WBC title he defended in fighting Khan. The WBC immediately awarded the title to Gennady Golovkin.

Return to light middleweight
lvarez vs. Liam Smith
On 24 June, it was announced that lvarez was to drop the extra pound to 154 and challenge 27 year old WBO champion Liam Smith (2301, 13 KOs) from England on 17 September 2016, in the main event of a card on HBO PPV. On 18 July, Golden Boy Promotions announced the bout would take place at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, after the MGM Grand in Las Vegas was the other venue looking to host the fight. Having fought his last five fights at his preferred 155-pound catchweight, Canelo said, ""I am very pleased to announce my next fight against Liam Smith, a tremendous fighter with real knockout power, and the WBO light middleweight world title owner, I have no doubt that this fight will be give and take, which will fill the expectations of the fans, and I will work with all the enthusiasm as I always do to get the upper hand on Sept. 17.""In front of a record breaking crowd of 51,240, lvarez regained a world title at light middleweight following a devastating left hook to the body in round nine. Smith was also knocked down once in round seven and once in round eight, in a fight where lvarez was in control from the opening bell. lvarez landed 157 punches from 422 thrown with a connect rate of 37%, compared to Smith landing 115 from 403 thrown, a connect rate of 29%. The fight drew an estimate of 300,000 PPV buys.Golden Boy president Eric Gomez spoke to Ring magazine in December, stating that lvarez had no immediate plans to vacate the WBO title and may fight in the first quarter of 2017 at 154, defending his world title. He also stated that there were still plans for lvarez to fight Golovkin later in the year.

Return to catchweight
lvarez vs. Chvez Jr.
Following Julio Csar Chvez Jr.'s comeback win against Dominik Britsch in December 2016, he claimed he was back and ready to fight Golovkin at 168 lbs and lvarez at a 164-pound catchweight. Negotiations began soon after for a potential HBO PPV fight to take place in 2017 on Cinco de Mayo weekend, as there was interest from both sides that a fight take place. De La Hoya said a fight with Golovkin would still be likely for September 2017. Golden Boy president Eric Gomez confirmed a catchweight of 165 lbs was agreed between both sides. WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman was on board, saying he would likely get his organisation involved in the bout and that it was a ""very attractive fight."" On 18 December, Julio Csar Chvez Sr. spoke about the ongoing negotiations, saying Golden Boy were offering his son a small amount for the potential big PPV fight. He went on to claim his son was offered a $5 million purse with no mention he would get a cut of the PPV revenue, a counter offer was submitted. A rematch clause was also discussed, which Chvez Jr. and his team had no problem with. Chvez Sr. went on to admit that he was fully aware lvarez is the A-side in the fight and would settle for no less than 3035% of the full revenue.On 22 December, the WBO made lvarez the mandatory challenger to the middleweight title, skipping the previous number one Avtandil Khurtsidze, which was considered controversial due to lvarez currently not fighting at middleweight. Khurtsidze, who had ten days to appeal decision, decided not to. On 24 December, lvarez and his team gave Chvez Jr. a week to accept the terms, which included a purse of $7 million, or he would consider other options. On 12 January 2017, De La Hoya and lvarez called for the contract to be signed, which was supposedly sent to Al Haymon, who advises Chvez Jr. and urged him to sign it. A day later, Chvez Jr. claimed he had agreed to all the demands set by lvarez and said that he would sign the contract. According to Chvez Jr., the new demands included a weight limit set at 164.5 lbs and a $6 million base purse, plus PPV revenue percentages.On 13 January, lvarez officially confirmed the fight to take place on 6 May 2017. A rematch clause was also put in place if Chvez Jr. wins the fight and another clause for every pound Chvez Jr. weighs over the limit, he would be fined $1 million. On 4 February, Golden Boy Promotions announced that the fight would take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada. On 22 February, lvarez announced that he planned on vacating his WBO light middleweight title following the Chvez Jr. fight and fighting at middleweight. On 3 March, The fight was announced a sell out on with 20,000 tickets being sold after they initially went on sale to the public on 20 February. On 11 April, lvarez spoke to boxing reporters in a teleconference and said that he would fight as a 160-pound middleweight after the Chvez Jr. fight.According to the NSAC, it was reported that lvarez would earn $5 million and Chvez Jr. would earn $3 million before any shares of PPV. The figures would increase based on PPV sales.In front of a sold-out crowd of 20,510, lvarez won the fight in dominant fashion via a shutout unanimous decision. All three judges scored it 120108 for lvarez. Chvez Jr. was very cautious throughout the fight. At times, he came forward and also had lvarez against the ropes, but failed to throw any punches. This led to jeers from the crowd in the later rounds due to a lack of action. lvarez spoke to HBO's Max Kellerman in the post-fight interview, talking about his fighting style, ""Tonight, I showed I could move, I could box, I showed as a fighter I can do all things. I thought I was going to showcase myself as a fighter that could throw punches, but he just wouldn't do it. I've shown I can do lots of things in the ring, anything a fighter brings, I've shown I can showcase myself."" CompuBox stats showed that lvarez landed 228 of 604 his punches thrown (38%) and Chvez Jr. landed 71 of 302 (24%). By the end of round five, lvarez landed 102 punches compared to Chvez Jr.'s 25 landed. Early figures revealed that the fight generated at least one million buys. A replay was shown on regular HBO a week later and drew an average of 769,000 viewers. This was the first boxing match to generate over a million PPV buys that didn't include Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya since 2002, which saw Lennox Lewis retain his heavyweight world titles against Mike Tyson. Later sources confirmed the fight did close to 1.2 million buys, which means it would have generated around $80 million.

Middleweight
lvarez vs. Golovkin
Immediately after the Chvez Jr. fight, lvarez announced that he would next fight Gennady Golovkin on 16 September 2017, at a location to be determined. Golovkin, who stated he would not attend the fight, was joined by his trainer Abel Sanchez and promoter Tom Loeffler. Golovkin joined him in the ring during the announcement to help promote their upcoming bout. Speaking through a translator, lvarez said, ""Golovkin, you are next, my friend. The fight is done. I've never feared anyone, since I was 15 fighting as a professional. When I was born, fear was gone."" When Golovkin arrived in the ring, he said, ""I feel very excited. Right now is a different story. In September, it will be a different style  a big drama show. I'm ready. Tonight, first congrats to Canelo and his team. Right now, I think everyone is excited for September. Canelo looked very good tonight, and 100 percent he is the biggest challenge of my career. Good luck to Canelo in September.""On 9 May, Eric Gomez, president of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that lvarez had an immediate rematch clause in place on his contract, whereas Golovkin, if he loses, won't be guaranteed a rematch. De La Hoya later revealed in an interview with ESPN that the fight would also take place at the full middleweight limit of 160 lbs with no rehydration clauses, meaning Golovkin and lvarez would be able to gain an unlimited amount of weight following the weigh in. On 5 June, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue of the fight and would mark the first time Golovkin would fight in the state of Nevada. The AT&T Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodgers Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions said in a statement that lvarez would fight for the IBF title, meaning he would participate in the second day weigh in where the IBF requires that each boxer weighs no more than ten lbs over the 160-pound limit. Although he said there was no word on whether lvarez would fight for the WBC title, lvarez claimed that he would not be. On 7 July 2017, Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out.On 15 August, Golden Boy matchmaker Robert Diaz revealed that lvarez would indeed attend the IBF mandatory second day weigh in and fully intended to fight for both the IBF title and the WBA title. He also made it clear that whilst Golovkin would still defend the WBC and IBO title, lvarez would not pay their sanctioning fees. On 22 August, IBF president Daryl Peoples announced that they would be dropping the mandatory second day weigh in for unification fights, meaning neither fighter is required to participate, however they would still encourage them to do so. It was reported that lvarez would earn a base minimum $5 million and Golovkin would earn $3 million, before any shares of the revenue are added to their purses.On fight night, in front of a sold-out crowd of 22,358, Golovkin and lvarez fought to a split draw (118110 lvarez, 115113 Golovkin, and 114114). ESPN's Dan Rafael and HBO's Harold Lederman scored the fight 116112 in favor of Golovkin. Judge Adalaide Byrd's scorecard of 118110 in favor of lvarez was widely ridiculed. Many observers felt that Golovkin had won a narrow, closely contested fight and while a draw was justifiable, a card that wide in favor of lvarez was inexcusable. Nevertheless, Bob Bennett, director of the Nevada Athletic Commission, said that he had full confidence in Byrd going forward. Despite the controversy, several mainstream media outlets referred to the bout as a ""classic"". The fight started with both boxers finding their rhythm, lvarez using his footwork and Golovkin establishing his jab. During the middle rounds, particularly between four and eight, lvarez started each round quickly, but seemed to tire out after a minute, with Golovkin taking over and doing enough to win the rounds. The championship rounds were arguably the best rounds and lvarez started to counter more and both fighters stood toe-to-toe exchanging swings, the majority of which missed. The draw saw Golovkin make his 19th consecutive defense, just one behind middleweight great Bernard Hopkins. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin was the busier of the two, landing 218 of 703 thrown (31%), while lvarez was more accurate, landing 169 of his 505 thrown (34%).

The replay, which took place a week later on HBO averaged 726,000, peaking at 840,000 viewers.Speaking to Max Kellerman after the fight, Golovkin said, ""It was a big drama show. [The scoring] is not my fault. I put pressure on him every round. Look, I still have all the belts. I am still the champion."" lvarez felt as though he won the fight, ""In the first rounds, I came out to see what he had. Then I was building from there. I think I won eight rounds. I felt that I won the fight. I think I was superior in the ring. I won at least seven or eight rounds. I was able to counterpunch and made Gennady wobble at least three times. If we fight again, it's up to the people. I feel frustrated over my draw."" Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez believed judge Byrd had her scorecard filled out before the first bell rang. lvarez ruled out another fight in 2017, claiming he would return on Cinco de Mayo weekend in May 2018. At the post-fight press conference, lvarez said through a translator, ""Look, right now I wanna rest. Whatever the fans want, whatever the people want and ask for, we'll do. You know that's my style. But right now, who knows if it's in May or September? But one thing's for sure  this is my era, the era of Canelo"". Golovkin's promoter Tom Loeffler stated that they would like an immediate rematch, but Golovkin, who prefers fighting at least three times in a calendar year, reiterated his desire to also fight in December.
The fight surpassed Mayweatherlvarez to achieve the third highest gate in boxing history. ESPN reported the fight generated $27,059,850 from 17,318 tickets sold. 934 complimentary tickets were given out, according to the NSAC.

lvarez vs. Golovkin II
Immediately after the controversial ending, talks began for a rematch between lvarez and Golovkin. lvarez stated he would next fight in May 2018, whereas Golovkin was open to fighting in December 2017. ESPN reported that lvarez, who only had the rematch clause in his contract, must activate it within three weeks of their fight. On 19 September, Golden Boy Promotions president Eric Gomez told ESPN that everyone on their side was interested in the rematch and they would hold discussions with Tom Loeffler in the coming days. Ringtv reported that the negotiations would begin on 22 September. On 24 September, Gomez said the rematch would likely take place in the first week of May 2018 or as early as March if a deal could be worked. Despite ongoing negotiations for the rematch, at the 55th annual convention in Baku, Azerbaijan on 2 October, the WBC officially ordered a rematch. Gomez reacted by telling ESPN, ""Regardless of if they did or didn't order the rematch, we are going to try to make it happen. We'll do whatever it takes to make it happen."" On 7 November, Gomez indicated the negotiations were going well and lvarez would make a decision in regards to the rematch in the following weeks. It was believed that Golden Boy would wait until after David Lemieux and Billy Joe Saunders fought for the latter's WBO title on 16 December 2017, before making a decision. On 15 November, Matchroom's Eddie Hearn, promoter of Daniel Jacobs, stated that he approached Tom Loeffler regarding a possible rematch between Golovkin and Jacobs if the lvarezGolovkin rematch failed to take place. On 20 December, Gomez announced that the negotiations were close to being finalized after lvarez gave Golden Boy the go-ahead to write up the contracts. On 29 January 2018, HBO finally announced the rematch would take place in May on Cinco de Mayo weekend. On 22 February, the T-Mobile Arena was again selected as the fight's venue. According to WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman, lvarez would fight Golovkin for their title this time around.In March 2018, lvarez tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol ahead of the fight. Adding to the controversy, Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez claimed that lvarez had his hands wrapped in an illegal manner for the first fight. On 23 March, the NSAC temporarily suspended lvarez due to his two positive tests for the banned substance clenbuterol. lvarez was required to appear at a commission hearing, either in person or via telephone, on the issue on 10 April. The commission would decide at the hearing whether the fight would be permitted to go ahead as scheduled. On 28 March, MGM Resorts International, who own the T-Mobile Arena, started to offer full refunds to anyone who had already purchased tickets for the bout. They wrote, ""In the event a fan requested a refund, they could get one at the original point of sale and in full."" The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported the news. The hearing was rescheduled for 18 April, as Bob Bennett filed a complaint against lvarez. On 3 April, lvarez officially withdrew from the rematch. Golden Boy mentioned during a press conference it was hinted that lvarez would likely not be cleared at the hearing and they would not have enough time to promote the fight.On 13 April, an unofficial source stated that lvarez had checked into a private hospital in Guadalajara for an arthroscopy knee surgery. A spokesperson for Golden Boy later said it was a cosmetic surgery. After surgery, lvarez posted a picture on social media with a caption reading, ""I share that today I had to undergo an arthroscopic surgery to repair the internal femoral cartilage and eliminate a pathological fold of my right knee."" Eric Gomez of Golden Boy later confirmed that lvarez had ""a cyst taken out of his knee"" and there were no serious issues with his knee.At the hearing, lvarez was given a six-month suspension, backdated to his first drug test fail on 17 February, meaning the ban would end on 17 August 2018. The Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) stated that lvarez was not enrolled in their testing program. His promoter De La Hoya then announced that lvarez would return to the ring on Mexican Independence Day weekend.According to Golovkin on 27 April, before he defeated Vanes Martirosyan, a fight with lvarez in the fall was still a priority. During a conference call, he stated it was the ""biggest fight in the world"" and beneficial for all parties involved. Although Golovkin stated the rematch had a ten percent chance of happening, Eric Gomez and Tom Loeffler agreed to meet and start negotiating after 5 May. One of the main issues preventing the rematch to take place was the purse split. lvarez wanted 6535 in his favor, the same terms Golovkin agreed to initially, however Golovkin wanted a straight 5050 split.On 6 June, Golovkin was stripped of his IBF title due to not adhering to the IBF's rules. The IBF granted Golovkin an exception to fight Martirosyan, although they would not sanction the fight and told Golovkin's team to start negotiating and fight mandatory challenger Sergiy Derevyanchenko by 3 August 2018. The IBF released a statement in detail explaining its decision to strip Golovkin of the belt. On 7 June, Golovkin's team stated they would accept a 5545 split in favor of lvarez. Five days later on 12 June, Golden Boy gave Golovkin a 24-hour deadline to accept a 5742 split in lvarez's favor or they would explore other fights. At this time, Golden Boy were already in light negotiations with Eddie Hearn for a fight against Daniel Jacobs instead. At the same time, Loeffler was working closely with Frank Warren to match Saunders with Golovkin at the end of August. Golovkin declined the offer and De La Hoya stated there would be no rematch. Despite this, some sources indicated both sides were still negotiating after a ""Hail Mary"" idea came to light. Hours later, De La Hoya confirmed via his Twitter account that terms had been agreed and the fight would indeed take place on 15 September at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Golovkin revealed to ESPN he agreed to 45%. lvarez started training for the bout on 14 June and stated his intention to apply for his boxing license on 18 August. It was confirmed that both boxers would not physically come face to face with each other until the fight week. A split-screen press conference took place on 3 July. On 3 September, due to a majority vote of the panel, it was announced that the vacant Ring middleweight title would be contested for the bout. Doug Fischer wrote, ""We posed the question to the ratings panel, which, in a landslide, voted in favor the magazine's 160-pound championship being up for grabs when the two stars clash at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.""In front of a sell out crowd of 21,965, the fight was again not without controversy as lvarez defeated Golovkin via majority decision after twelve rounds. lvarez was favored by judges Dave Moretti and Steve Weisfeld, both scoring the bout 115113, the third judge Glenn Feldman scored it 114114. The result was disputed by fans, pundits and media. Of the 18 media outlets scoring the bout, ten ruled in favor of Golovkin, seven scored a draw while one scored the bout for lvarez. The scorecards showed how close the bout was, with the judges splitting eight rounds. After nine rounds, all three judges had their scorecards reading 8784 for lvarez.The fight was much different from the first bout in terms of action. lvarez who was described by Golovkin's team as a ""runner"", altered his style and became more aggressive. Both boxers found use of their respective jabs from the opening round with Golovkin using his jab more as the fight went on. Big punches were landed by both fighters during the bout, with both lvarez and Golovkin showing excellent chins. Despite the tense build up, both boxers showed each other respect after the fight. lvarez made good use of his body attack, landing 46 compared to Golovkin's six landed. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin landed 234 of 879 punches thrown (27%) and lvarez landed 202 of his 622 punches (33%). Golovkin had the edge in jabs, landing 118 out of 547 (21.6%) compared to 59 out of 256 (23%) for lvarez. However, lvarez had the edge in power punches, landing 143 out of 366 (39.1%) compared to 116 out of 332 (34.9%) for Golovkin. In eight of the rounds Golovkin outlanded lvarez in total punches whereas lvarez outlanded him in power punches in 9 of the rounds.lvarez stated that the fight was a ""clear victory"" and that ""in the end, it was a victory for Mexico. And again, it was an opportunity. And I want to shout out to my opponent, the best in the sport of boxing. I am a great fighter, and I showed it tonight. If the people want another round, I'll do it again. But for right now, I will enjoy time with my family."" Golovkin did not take part in the post-fight and made his way backstage where he received stitches for a cut over his right eye. He later responded to the defeat, explaining that ""I'm not going to say who won tonight, because the victory belongs to Canelo, according to the judges. I thought it was a very good fight for the fans and very exciting. I thought I fought better than he did."" Both fighters were open to a trilogy.The fight generated a live gate of $23,473,500 from 16,732 tickets sold. This was lower than the first bout, but still the fourth largest-grossing gates in Nevada boxing history. The fight sold 1.1 million PPV buys, lower than the first bout; however, due to being priced at $84.95, it generated more revenue at around $94 million.

Super middleweight
lvarez vs. Fielding
In October 2018, lvarez announced that he would move up to the super middleweight division for the first time in his career to fight 31-year-old British boxer Rocky Fielding (271, 15 KOs) at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York on 15 December 2018, for the WBA (Regular) super middleweight title. On 17 October 2018, DAZN announced that it had signed a five-year, $365 million deal with lvarez, under which his next eleven fights would be broadcast in the U.S. by the subscription sports streaming service. The deal would begin with lvarez vs. Fielding and replace his expired contract with HBO (which had also announced its discontinuation of boxing telecasts). lvarez won the one-sided bout via third-round technical knockout after repeatedly downing Fielding with body shots. Following the fourth knockdown suffered by Fielding, referee Ricky Gonzalez stopped the match.

Light heavyweight
lvarez vs. Kovalev
On 13 September 2019, lvarez announced via social media that he would move up two weight classes to challenge WBO light heavyweight titleholder Sergey Kovalev on 2 November 2019, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. After a competitive first ten rounds in which Kovalev found success with his jab while lvarez largely utilized power punches, the latter produced a left hook, straight right combination to stop Kovalev in the eleventh round to become a four-division world champion. At the time of the stoppage, lvarez led 9694 on two of the judges' scorecards, with the other scorecard even at 9595. He joined Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Mike McCallum as the only former junior middleweight champions in history to win a title at light heavyweight. Among them, only Hearns, Leonard, and Alvarez himself established their careers at welterweight and claimed the title at the 175 pound limit.After the fight, Kovalev suggested that he had always been unlikely to win the fight, due to the grueling schedule of back-to-back training camps which resulted from the short period of time between fighting Anthony Yarde on 24 August and lvarez on 2 November, but he had agreed to fight the latter regardless due to the high financial incentive, reported to be $12 million. lvarez himself was reported to have received a purse of $35 million for the fight. lvarez responded by calling Kovalev a ""bad loser"".For his 2019 campaign, lvarez was named the fighter of the year by The Ring Magazine, ESPN, Sports Illustrated, and the Boxing Writers Association of America.

On 6 November 2020, lvarez was released from his contract with Golden Boy Promotions after a lawsuit was settled for breach of contract.

lvarez vs. Callum Smith
On 17 November via social media, lvarez announced he would be facing undefeated WBA (Super) and The Ring super middleweight champion Callum Smith on 19 December 2020, with the vacant WBC title also at stake. The fight was held at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. lvarez's trainer Eddy Reynoso revealed that his fighter had been sparring with undefeated heavyweight Frank Snchez in preparation for the bout. On the night, lvarez controlled the action over twelve rounds, inflicting Smith with a detached left biceps injury as he won by unanimous decision with scores of 119109, 119109, 117111.

lvarez vs. Yldrm
It was announced on 20 January 2021 that lvarez would be defending his titles against WBC mandatory challenger Avni Yldrm on 27 February at the Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida. The bout attracted criticism due to many perceiving Yldrm, who had not been in the ring since he lost a technical split decision to Anthony Dirrell two years prior in February 2019, to be vastly over-matched. Yldrm had been named to the mandatory position as a result of the controversial nature of his loss to Dirrell, however, he had remained sidelined due to injury and the COVID-19 pandemic. lvarez, who was mandated to face Yldrm in order to retain the WBC title despite being heavily favored, was dismissive of the critics, saying ""I really don't have to give any explanation because they're never gonna be happy with anything... He [Yldrm] has lots of courage. He can be dangerous at any moment because he is a strong fighter.""In a one-sided fight, lvarez defeated Yldrm by third-round corner retirement after Yldrm's corner threw in the towel at the end of the third round. According to CompuBox stats, lvarez outlanded Yldrm 67 (40%) to 11 (11%) in total punches and 58 (59%) to 4 (22%) in power punches. In the third round, lvarez threw 53 power punches. lvarez later stated that he had contracted COVID-19 prior to the fight and only had one month to train.

lvarez vs. Saunders
After lvarez's successful defense against Avni Yldrm, promoter Eddie Hearn confirmed lvarez would be facing WBO titleholder and undefeated two-weight world champion Billy Joe Saunders in a unification bout on May 8 at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Prior to the fight, there was a dispute between the two fighters' camps regarding the size of the ring: Saunders was unhappy with the proposed 18-foot ring. He instead wanted a 24-foot ring and threatened to pull out of the fight if his request wasn't met, despite having boxed primarily in 20-foot rings in his bouts in the past in the United Kingdom. He ultimately settled for a 22-foot ring after lvarez said, ""I don't care about the size of the ring, I'm just gonna go in there and do my job. It's not the only excuse he's had. He's had plenty of excuses,"" referencing when Saunders had previously voiced his concerns about the selection of judges for the fight.In front of a record breaking crowd of 73,126 for boxing attendance at an indoor facility in the United States, lvarez won via eighth-round corner retirement when Saunders' team threw in the towel due to Saunders having suffered a fractured orbital bone as a result of an uppercut landed by lvarez. At the time of the stoppage, lvarez was winning on the scorecards 7874 (twice) and 7775. Throughout the fight, lvarez outlanded Saunders 73 to 60 in total punches and landed 53% of his power punches.In the immediate post-fight press conference, lvarez was confronted by undefeated WBO middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade who asked him when they were going to fight, before accusing lvarez of ducking him. lvarez responded to him in English dismissively, calling him a ""horrible fighter"", and criticizing his resume: ""Man, you fight with nobody. You are a champion but you fight with nobody."" Before Andrade was removed from the press conference, lvarez told him, ""Get the fuck outta here. Please, get the fuck outta here. Get the fuck outta here because I'm gonna fuck you up right now motherfucker.""

lvarez vs. Plant
After months of negotiations, lvarez announced on his social media on 19 August 2021 that he would be facing undefeated IBF champion Caleb Plant on 6 November at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, in an undisputed showdown for all four major world titles in the super middleweight division, with the winner set to become the first ever undisputed champion at that weight class. On 21 September 2021, the two fighters were engaged in a brief onstage scuffle during their first press conference, in which lvarez initiated physical contact during their face-off when he shoved Plant. lvarez stated that he had done this because he took offense to Plant's use of the word ""motherfucker"", interpreting it as an insult to his mother. Plant denied to reporters that he had used the common American curse word in that context. Moreover, he drew attention to lvarez's hypocrisy, accurately indicating that lvarez had previously used the same slur against Demetrius Andrade on the night of 8 May 2021 in the aftermath of his fight against Billy Joe Saunders in Arlington, Texas.On fight night, lvarez won the bout via eleventh-round technical knockout. He had knocked his opponent to the canvas with a left hook right uppercut combination in the penultimate round, before closing in to drop Plant again, prompting referee Russell Mora to call off the bout. At the time of the stoppage, lvarez was ahead on the scorecards with 9892, 9694, and 9793. With this win, he became only the sixth fighter to unify all belts in one division in the four-belt era.

Return to light heavyweight
lvarez vs. Bivol
At the WBC Convention on 15 November 2021 in Mexico City, the WBC approved the request of lvarez's trainer and manager, Eddy Reynoso, to have lvarez challenge Ilunga Makabu for his WBC cruiserweight title. lvarez has never competed at cruiserweight, so Reynoso had needed to petition the WBC to order the title fight. The cruiserweight limit was 200 pounds, but it had recently been reduced to 190 pounds by the WBC due to the introduction of bridgerweight. The fight had been rumored to take place in May 2022. This ultimately did not materialize, as Makabu was forced into a mandatory defense of his title in a rematch against Thabiso Mchunu on 29 January 2022, which the former won via split decision. Instead, it was announced on 25 February 2022 that lvarez had signed a two-fight deal with Matchroom Boxing; the first fight would see him returning to the light heavyweight division to challenge undefeated WBA (Super) champion Dmitry Bivol on 7 May in a bout that would be televised as sports streaming service DAZN's first pay-per-view offering in the United States and Canada.In a surprise upset, all three judges scored the bout 115113 in Bivol's favor to hand lvarez the second defeat of his professional career. According to CompuBox punch statistics, Bivol had outlanded lvarez in every single round of the fight, for a total of 152 punches landed out of 710 thrown (21%), compared to lvarez's 84 of 495 (17%). Many media reporters and pundits drew attention to the judges' official scorecards: all three judges had scored lvarez the winner of the first four rounds, something that was roundly criticized, and described by ESPN reporter Mike Coppinger as ""puzzling"". Despite the widespread public opinion that Bivol was the deserved winner, lvarez disagreed with this notion, stating in his post-fight interview: ""I don't feel like I lost the fight... Personally, I felt he [Bivol] only won four or five rounds."" He went on to express his desire to fight Bivol again: ""We want the rematch, and we're going to do better in the rematch."" Despite this, a rematch between lvarez and Bivol did not materialize immediately, as the former opted to face WBA (Super) and IBF middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin in a trilogy bout as his opponent for his next fight instead.

Return to super middleweight
lvarez vs. Golovkin III
Despite lvarez expressing his desire to avenge his loss against WBA (Super) light heavyweight champion Dmitry Bivol in a rematch, on 24 May 2022 it was announced that lvarez would instead be returning to the super middleweight division to defend his undisputed titles against Gennady Golovkin in a trilogy bout on 17 September. The bout would see Golovkin, the WBA (Super) and IBF middleweight champion, compete in the super middleweight division for the first time in his career, while it was lvarez's sixth bout in the same weight class.In the first pre-fight press conference on 25 June 2022 in Los Angeles, lvarez described the rivalry between him and Golovkin as ""personal"" rather than simply competitive. lvarez stated of his opponent: ""He always pretends to be a nice guy but he's an asshole. He's an asshole person... He's talking a lot of things about me. That's why it's personal."" lvarez went on to express his excitement at the prospect of sending his opponent into retirement, and admitted that he received gratification from making Golovkin wait four years for a trilogy bout on his own terms, in his preferred weight class of super middleweight: ""It makes me feel good.""On fight night, lvarez defeated Golovkin via unanimous decision with the scores of 115113 (twice) and 116112.

lvarez vs. Ryder
On 14 March 2023, it was announced that lvarez would be making the second defense of his undisputed super middleweight titles against WBO interim champion John Ryder at Estadio Akron in his hometown of Guadalajara, Mexico on 6 May. The bout would mark lvarez's first bout in his home nation in over eleven years.lvarez won via unanimous decision after the judges scored the fight 118109 (twice) and 120107 in his favor after 12 rounds.

IBF super featherweight champion
Davis vs. Pedraza
On November 15, 2016 ESPN announced that Davis would challenge for the IBF super featherweight title against undefeated Jos Pedraza (220, 12 KOs) on January 14, 2017, at the Barclays Center in New York on Showtime. The fight would take place as an undercard fight to the super middleweight world title unification fight between James DeGale and Badou Jack. The IBF granted Pedraza an exemption to fight Davis, as he had a mandatory fight against Liam Walsh looming. Prior to the fight being announced, Mayweather Promotions matchmakers tried to make a deal for Davis to fight titleholder Jason Sosa. Davis defeated Pedraza in a seventh-round KO to win the IBF super featherweight title. After the fight, Davis said that he had studied the early career of his promoter and mentor, Floyd Mayweather Jr., in order to stay composed. He said, ""I had a lot of experience [from the amateur ranks], but I learned how to keep my composure. Floyd told me to stay calm, and I studied Floyd Mayweather [videos] when he was 'Pretty Boy.' My uppercut was my best shot, and it was landing all night. It felt really good to fight the way I did. I could take it and dish it out."" Mayweather Jr. himself enthusiastically branded his protg as the future of boxing. For the fight, Davis earned $75,000 compared to Pedraza, who earned the larger sum of $225,000, in what was his third defense. At the time of stoppage, Davis was ahead 5955 on all three judges' scorecards.

Davis vs. Walsh
On May 7, 2017, it was announced Davis would travel to London, England for his first title defense. The news came from Frank Warren, promoter of challenger Liam Walsh (210, 14 KO), who was also ranked number 1 by the IBF. The fight was scheduled to take place on May 20, 2017, and billed as 'Show me the Money'. At the official weigh in on May 19, Davis made weight on his third attempt. His first attempt, although he was naked, he weighed two ounces over. He was then given two hours to attempt to lose the extra weight, although he came back earlier thinking he had lost it. He eventually met the limit of 130 pounds on his third attempt. Davis stopped Walsh in the third-round to retain his IBF title. After two cagey rounds, which were controlled by Davis, he came out with power punches at the start of the third. Walsh's legs looked to give way and Davis pounced with accurate hooks to the head, eventually dropping Walsh. Walsh beat the count on unsteady legs. The fight resumed and Davis went on the attack again, connecting with every shot he threw, forcing referee Michael Alexander to stop the fight. The time of stoppage was 2 minutes and 11 seconds of round three. Many at ringside believed the stoppage was premature, including Walsh, ""That was a bad stoppage. He's very fast and very active but it was too quick. He won fair and square but in England sometimes they stop the fight too early."" Davis believed he would have caught Walsh eventually. The fight was shown live on Showtime in the U.S. averaging 228,000 viewers and peaking at 253,000 viewers.

Davis vs. Fonseca
According to TMZ Sports in early July 2017, it was reported that Davis would feature in the co-main event of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor on August 26, 2017, at the T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada. On July 29, The Ring magazine reported that Davis would likely defend his IBF title against former WBO champion Romn Martnez, whose last fight was a KO loss to Vasyl Lomachenko in June 2016. On August 10, Ringtv reported that Davis would instead fight unbeaten prospect Francisco Fonseca (1901, 13 KOs), who at the time was ranked number 7 by the IBF. According to some sources, the potential fight with Martnez was dropped due to notice and Martnez would not have had enough time to make the 130-pound limit. Prior to the fight being announced, the IBF had ordered Fonseca to fight their number 3 ranked Billy Dib (424, 24 KOs) in a final eliminator, as they were the two highest ranked available. At the weigh in, Fonseca came in at the 130-pound limit. Davis showed up an hour late and came in at 132 pounds, 2 pounds over the weight limit. Davis declined to weigh in after two hours, forcing the IBF to strip him of the title. The title was declared vacant, but the title would be still up for grabs if Fonseca secured victory. In what was billed as an easy fight for Davis, he won the fight via KO in round eight, with the ending being controversial. The final punch appeared to be an illegal punch to the back of the head to Fonseca and referee Russell Mora counted him out 39 seconds into the round. After the fight, Davis mocked Fonseca. Fonseca appeared hurt before the knockout blow, which Davis, who was being booed by the crowd, explained to Jim Gray of Showtime in the post fight interview, ""I actually caught him with a body shot before that and he was hurt. So he took advantage of me hitting him in the back of his head and went down."" With the win, Davis scored his tenth-straight KO victory. Due to Davis winning the fight, the IBF title remained vacant. For the fight, Davis earned a purse of $600,000 compared to the amount $35,000 that Fonseca received.

WBA (Super) super featherweight champion
Davis vs. Cuellar
On November 15, 2017, Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions announced that Davis would be making his in ring return in the first quarter of 2018 alongside stablemate Badou Jack. He also revealed that Davis would fight a high-level opponent. According to Ellerbe, Davis would remain at super featherweight and likely challenge for a world title in 2018. On January 24, 2018, Showtime announced that Davis would next appear on television on the undercard of Broner vs. Vargas on April 21 at the Barclays Center in New York. A day later, Ellerbe stated a deal was close to being reached for Davis to fight former world champion and IBF #3 Billy Dib (434, 24 KOs, 2 NC) in what would be an IBF eliminator. A purse bid, which was due to take place on January 25 was postponed to February 6. On February 21, it was reported by ESPN that the fight would not happen. Instead it was stated Davis' likely opponent would be former featherweight champion Jess Cuellar (282, 21 KOs). On March 5, the fight was finalized for the vacant WBA (Regular) super featherweight title. Prior to the fight, Alberto Machado, the WBA (Super) champion at the same weight class, was inexplicably downgraded to 'Regular' champion, and the Davis-Cuellar fight was upgraded to be for Machado's WBA (Super) super featherweight title.
In front of 13,964 in attendance, Davis knocked out Cuellar in round three. Davis first knocked down Cuellar in round two courtesy of a left hook to the body and then put him down twice in round three to get the stoppage.

The bout opened Showtime's broadcast and averaged 460,000 viewers and peaked at 527,000 viewers.

Davis vs. Ruiz
In November 2018, Davis announced that he would defend his WBA title in February 2019 against former three-weight world champion Abner Mares (3131, 15 KOs) in Southern California. The fight was first teased by Mayweather via social media in August 2018, with no mention of a date or venue. The fight would see Mares moving up from featherweight, having lost his last fight in June 2018 against Lo Santa Cruz. When the fight was announced, there was a lot of talk of Mares being 'thrown to the wolves' and that he had no real chance against Davis. Mares hit back at critics explaining it was his decision to move up in weight and test himself. On December 14, the fight was confirmed to take place on February 9, 2019, at the Pechanga Arena in San Diego on Showtime. A week later the venue was changed to Dignity Health Sports Park, in Carson, California, formerly known as StubHub Center.Mares and Davis ultimately did not fight on the scheduled date after Mares suffered a potential career ending injury, a detached retina, during sparring. Instead Davis faced challenger Hugo Ruiz, ranked #9 by the WBA at super featherweight. Davis knocked Ruiz out in the first round after breaking the challenger's nose.

Davis vs. Nez
On July 27, 2019, Davis made the second defense of his WBA (Super) super featherweight title when he beat Ricardo Nez by second-round technical knockout in front of a crowd of 12,000 fans in his home city of Baltimore, Maryland. Davis took his time feeling out his opponent in the first round. In the second round, after receiving a couple of punches from Nunez, Davis went into attack mode and connected multiple times on Nunez, which prompted the referee to jump in and stop the fight. His win marked the first time a native of Baltimore had returned to the city to defend a world title since featherweight champion Harry Jeffra defeated Spider Armstrong in 1940.

WBA (Regular) lightweight champion
Davis vs. Gamboa
On December 28, 2019, Davis moved up to the lightweight division for the first time, and captured the vacant WBA (Regular) lightweight title when he defeated former unified featherweight world champion Yuriorkis Gamboa by twelfth-round technical knockout. Gamboa was ranked #2 by the WBA at lightweight at the time. This was the first occasion that Davis had fought past the ninth round. He had dropped Gamboa in the second and eighth rounds, and built up a big lead on the judges' scorecards by the time that referee Jack Reiss stopped the fight in the final round, with scores of 10998 twice and 10997 all in favor of the eventual winner. His dominance was reflected in the final CompuBox punch stats, with Davis landing 120 of 321 punches thrown (37%), while Gamboa landed 78 of 617 thrown (13%).

At the time of the stoppage, Davis was leading on all three judges' scorecards by the identical margin, 4847. Over the course of just under six rounds, Davis had been out-landed and out-thrown by his opponent despite being the more accurate boxer: he landed 84 of 227 punches thrown (37%), while Santa Cruz landed 97 of 390 thrown (25%).

Davis vs. Cruz
On October 6, 2021, Davis announced that he would be facing undefeated former WBA interim lightweight champion Rolando Romero on December 5 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Showtime PPV. However, Romero was pulled from the bout due to sexual assault allegations made against him, and was subsequently replaced with Isaac Cruz. On the night, Davis went the 12-round distance for the first time in his career, winning via unanimous decision, with the judges' scorecards reading 115113, 115113 and 116112 in his favor. In his post-fight interview, he explained that he had fought through an injury: I hurt my left hand in probably the sixth round. It is what it is, thats what comes with the sport. I felt that later in the fight, he [Cruz] was breaking down, but I hurt my hand so I couldn't get him out of there."" Additionally, Davis showed respect toward his opponent Cruz, saying, ""A star was born tonight"". When asked about the prospect of facing other top lightweights in the division, specifically undefeated champions George Kambosos Jr. and Devin Haney, as well as Ryan Garca, Davis did not directly answer, although he opined, ""All them guys is easy work. Im the top dog.""

Davis vs. Romero
Once Rolando Romero revealed on his Instagram page in January 2022 that no charges against him were filed, as the claims of sexual abuse could not be substantiated, the WBA once again ordered Davis to make a mandatory lightweight title defense against Romero, and gave the pair until February 24 to come to terms. The pair agreed to face each other on May 28, in the main event of a Showtime PPV, at the Barclays Center in New York City. He knocked out Romero in the 6th round.

Soon after, a fight broke out in the crowd at ringside with 2 minutes and 8 seconds left in the eighth round, causing the fight to be temporarily halted. When the action was resumed, Davis found success again with his left hand, visibly hurting Garca.

Controversies and legal issues
Throughout his career, Paul has become the subject of many controversies due to his behavior, including being charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly.

Content controversies
On January 3, 2018, Paul uploaded a video to his YouTube channel titled ""I lost my virginity"" which used a thumbnail of himself and his then-girlfriend Erika Costell posing semi-nude on top of each other. The video was age-restricted by YouTube as a result, and critics such as Keemstar criticized the thumbnail as being inappropriate for his younger audience. The thumbnail was later changed with both Paul and Costell fully clothed and not touching each other. Two days later, on January 5, TMZ revealed a video in which Paul used the racial epithet ""nigga"" multiple times while freestyle rapping.On November 29, 2020, Paul sparked frustration after stating he paved the way for content house creation and boxing matches between high-profile social media stars. Many objected to Paul's claim, observing that he did not create the first content house, nor was he the first YouTube star to fight in a boxing match.

Scam allegations
On January 3, 2018, Paul started the website Edfluence, a program claiming to teach younger people how to be successful, learn life skills, and earn money online. The course cost $7 per user, which would allow the user to unlock a series of videos for a ""roadmap"" to success as an influencer. However, the seven dollars did not unlock the entire program, but only gave a few basic tips. Paul also promised his audience that if they joined the course, they would get to join ""Team 1000"", which did not happen. Following the situation, Paul was accused of scamming young followers and stealing their money. Then, two years later, on January 31, 2020, Edfluence was shut down, which stopped the course permanently. On February 15, Paul announced that he would partner with Los Angeles-based brand development group GenZ Holdings Inc. to create a $19.99-per-month platform aimed at teaching children how to build an online presence. ""The Financial Freedom Movement"" promises to give subscribers access to ""Jake Pauls personal experience, rituals and secret formula"" and ""cutting edge mentorship, coaching, and training"". The program has been criticized by some, with one interviewer questioning whether it would send a dangerous message to his young fanbase.On January 3, 2019, Paul, along with fellow YouTuber RiceGum, came under fire for promoting MysteryBrand, a website that offers the chance to open a digital ""mystery box"" of pre-selected items with a promise to win one in real life at random. Many users have said they have not received prizes they won through the site.On February 18, 2022, in a class-action lawsuit filed against the cryptocurrency company SafeMoon that alleged the company is a pump and dump scheme, Paul was named as a defendant along with musician Nick Carter, rappers Soulja Boy and Lil Yachty, and social media personality Ben Phillips for promoting the SafeMoon token on their social media accounts with misleading information as part of the 2022 Safemoon fraud allegations. On the same day, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media. In March 2022, YouTuber Coffeezilla uploaded a video in which he accused Paul of using cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens to scam his fans out of $2.2 million.

Party complaints, public nuisance lawsuits, and COVID-19
In addition to the 2017 public complaints that eventually led to Paul's dismissal from Bizaardvark, Paul's neighbors in the Beverly Grove neighborhood of Los Angeles filed a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Paul. This came after Paul made his home address public, leading crowds of fans to gather outside Paul's residence, and noise complaints by neighbors. On April 24, 2018, it was reported that Paul was being sued by Cobra Acquisitions, the company that owns the house, for $2.5 million.On February 23, 2020, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Paul was involved in an altercation with British singer Zayn Malik at Westgate, the hotel near the MGM Grand Garden Arena at which the two were staying. Paul and Malik's rooms were right across from each other and when Paul's older brother, Logan, went to Paul's hotel room, an argument broke out between Malik and Paul because Paul believed Malik was using a rude tone. Following the interaction, Paul posted about it on Twitter, which drew attention from Malik's girlfriend and American model Gigi Hadid. Paul later deleted his tweets which criticized Malik and then posted another tweet stating that he tweeted about the incident since he was drunk, acknowledging the fact in a tweet later in the day, writing, ""someone needs to take my phone when i'm drunk because I am a fucking idiot"". Logan released the video footage on the 161st episode of his podcast, Impaulsive, in which he explained the whole situation.On July 11, 2020, Paul threw a large party at his home in Calabasas, California, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Dozens of people attended without wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. After complaints from neighbors and videos surfaced on social media, Calabasas mayor Alicia Weintraub expressed outrage, saying, ""They're having this large party, no social distancing, no masks, its just a big huge disregard for everything that everybody is trying to do to get things back to functioning."" She continued, saying, ""It's really just a party acting like COVID does not exist, it's acting that businesses aren't closed"". She later added that the city was looking into ""all of our options"" regarding penalties for Paul and the attendees of the party.On November 25, 2020, Paul attracted further COVID-related controversy due to statements in an interview with The Daily Beast. When interviewer Marlow Stern asked Paul if he regretted his words and actions regarding the July 11 party, Paul responded by saying that COVID-19 was a ""hoax"", also stating that ""98 percent of news [about COVID-19] is fake"", and that he believed the measures against COVID-19 in the United States should end, calling them ""the most detrimental thing to our society."" He then incorrectly stated that the flu had killed as many people in the United States in 2020 as COVID-19 did, and claimed that ""Medical professionals have [recently] also said that masks do absolutely nothing to prevent the spread of coronavirus""; he later referred to said professionals as ""dozens of my medical friends."" When Stern tried to question his claims, Paul told Stern ""You're arrogant. You're very arrogant"", ""you want clickbait"", and ""I've never even heard of you."" The interview sparked condemnation from various individuals and media outlets, and fellow YouTuber Tyler Oakley, who called Paul ""aggressively ignorant"" and ""embarrassing.""

Attending a riot at an Arizona mall and FBI raid
On May 30, 2020, Paul and a few of his friends came to have dinner at P. F. Chang's outside of Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, Arizona, as part of the George Floyd protests, where it escalated quickly and people began looting the mall. Multiple instances of footage show Paul and his friends outside of  P. F. Chang's witnessing the riot and they made their way inside the mall where they documented the incident. People on social media criticized Paul for entering the mall and standing in the middle of the mall witnessing people looting stores. Paul later apologized on social media condemning the violence, and also denied the accusations of looting, instead saying he was filming as a public service for a future video. Paul said, ""We filmed everything we saw in an effort to share our experience and bring more attention to the anger felt in every neighborhood we travelled through; we were strictly documenting, not engaging."" On June 4, 2020, Paul was charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly, both misdemeanor charges, for being in the mall during the riot. On August 5, 2020, Paul's Calabasas mansion was raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In a statement to the Los Angeles Times the FBI stated, ""The FBI is executing a federal search warrant at a residence in Calabasas in connection with an ongoing investigation."" On the same day, the charges were dismissed without prejudice, the Scottsdale Police Department said it was ""in the best interest of the community"" and would allow a federal criminal investigation to be completed. Paul also explained in a now-deleted video that the raid was ""completely related to the looting controversy"". In August 2021 it was reported Paul would not face federal charges over the incident.

Sexual assault allegations
On April 9, 2021, a video was released by TikTok personality Justine Paradise who alleged that Paul forced her into oral sex and touched her without her consent during an incident at the Team 10 House in 2019. Paul responded to the accusations, saying, ""Sexual assault accusations aren't something that I, or anyone should ever take lightly, but to be crystal clear, this claim made against me is 100% false.""  In a later video Paradise stated she received harassment and death threats over the accusation.On April 22, 2021, an article about Paul in The New York Times featured a second accusation by model and actress Railey Lollie. Lollie, who had started working for Paul at 17, alleged that Paul would call her ""jailbait"", and at one point groped her.

Investigation in Puerto Rico
On May 15, 2021, Paul was investigated by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources for riding a motorized vehicle on Puerto Rico's beaches, seen on a video that was posted online but then removed. It is illegal to ride motorized vehicles on Puerto Rico's beaches in order to protect natural wildlife such as sea turtles. Paul apologized stating he had intended no harm.

SEC fine for undisclosed cryptocurrencies sponsorship
In March 2023, Paul was among eight celebrities charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with violating investor protection laws by promoting cryptocurrencies without disclosing that he had been sponsored to do so. He settled the charges for over $400,000 without admitting or denying the claims.

In January 2022, Forbes announced that Paul made approximately $38 million from boxing in 2021, making him the 46th highest paid athlete in the world for that period.Paul began dating fellow American YouTuber and internet personality Tana Mongeau in April 2019. In June 2019, the couple announced that they were engaged, although many fans and commentators did not believe that the engagement was legitimate. On July 28 of that year, Paul and Mongeau exchanged vows in Las Vegas. InTouch later reported that the couple had not obtained a marriage license prior to the ceremony and that the officiant was also not licensed by the state of Nevada. As a result, the marriage was not legally binding. Buzzfeed reported that Paul and Mongeau left the ceremony separately. The ceremony, which was available on pay-per-view for $50, was recorded by MTV for the show No Filter: Tana Mongeau. On an episode of the show, Mongeau stated that the ceremony was something ""fun and lighthearted that we're obviously doing for fun and for content."" The couple announced their break-up in January 2020.On April 3, 2023, Paul and Dutch speed skater Jutta Leerdam publicly confirmed being a couple, after the two had gotten in touch via Instagram a few months earlier.

Diaz missed weight, coming in at 160.6 pounds. He was given additional time to make the lightweight limit, and cut down to 155.2.   However, he was still fined 20 percent of his purse, which went to Rafael dos Anjos. Diaz, who seemed unmotivated and annoyed for most of the fight, lost the one-sided fight via unanimous decision (3026, 3026, and 3027).

2015
Diaz was briefly linked to a welterweight bout with Matt Brown on July 11, 2015, at UFC 189.  However, in mid-April, Brown announced that the pairing had been scrapped.After sitting out again for over a year, Diaz returned to face Michael Johnson on December 19, 2015, at UFC on Fox 17. He won the fight via unanimous decision and went on to give one of the most infamous post-fight interviews in UFC history, where he called out Conor McGregor by saying ""you're taking everything I work for, motherfucker, and I'ma fight your fucking ass"" on live broadcast television.  Both participants were awarded Fight of the Night honors.

2016
Diaz was set as a replacement to face Conor McGregor on March 5, 2016, at UFC 196, filling in for an injured Rafael dos Anjos. With Diaz only having eleven days notice, the fight took place at welterweight (170 lbs) due to lack of time to cut weight. Diaz won the fight via submission in the second round. This gave Diaz his ninth submission victory in the UFC, tied for the second-most all-time behind only Royce Gracie. Both fighters were awarded Fight of the Night honors and Diaz was also awarded with the Performance of the Night bonus.A rematch with McGregor was scheduled for July 9, 2016, at UFC 200. However, on April 19, the UFC announced that McGregor had been pulled from the event after failing to fulfill media obligations in Las Vegas related to the fight. In turn, the fight with McGregor was rescheduled and took place the following month, contested again at welterweight, at UFC 202. Diaz lost the rematch via majority decision. The contest was once again awarded Fight of the Night honors.At the UFC 202 post-fight press conference, Diaz violated the USADA rule by smoking CBD, Cannabidiol, vape pen within four hours after a fight. He was not sanctioned as CBD is not considered a PED. USADA changed their rules and lifted CBD from the banned list not long after.

2018
After a two-year-long layoff, it was announced on August 3, 2018, that Diaz was expected to return on November 3 against Dustin Poirier in a lightweight bout. This bout was expected to serve as the co-headliner of UFC 230. However, on October 9, 2018, it was announced that Poirier pulled out due to injury and as a result, the bout was canceled.

2019
Nate Diaz returned to competition on August 17 at UFC 241. He faced Anthony Pettis in a welterweight bout which served as the co-main event. With a dominant performance, he won the fight by unanimous decision.Diaz faced Jorge Masvidal on November 2, 2019, in the main event of UFC 244. In a unique situation, UFC President Dana White confirmed that the headlining bout was for a celebratory ""baddest motherfucker"" ('BMF') belt. After being dominated for most of the fight, Diaz lost the fight via TKO between rounds three and four when the cage-side physician determined a cut over Diaz's right eye rendered him unable to continue.

2021
Diaz was expected to face Leon Edwards on May 15, 2021, at UFC 262 in the event's co-headliner, marking the first time a non-main event and non-title bout had been scheduled for 5 rounds. However, the bout was moved to UFC 263 due to a minor injury sustained by Diaz and eventually took place for five rounds as well. Edwards controlled a vast majority of the bout, but was stunned badly with punches late in the fifth. Edwards won the fight by unanimous decision (4946, 4946, 4946).

2022
On the last fight of his UFC contract, Diaz was scheduled to face Khamzat Chimaev on September 10, 2022, in the main event of UFC 279. However, at the weigh-ins on September 9, Chimaev weighed in at 178.5 pounds, seven-and-a-half pounds over the welterweight non-title fight limit. As a result of Chimaev missing weight, he was removed from his bout with Diaz. Diaz instead faced Tony Ferguson in the main event. Diaz won the fight via a guillotine choke submission in the fourth round. This win earned Diaz his second Performance of the Night bonus award. Diaz opted to not re-sign with the UFC before the bout with Ferguson, thus making Diaz a free agent once the fight concluded.
